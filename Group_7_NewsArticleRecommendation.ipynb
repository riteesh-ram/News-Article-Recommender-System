            "AstraZeneca, the developer of the coronavirus vaccine being manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and sold as Covishield, has sent a legal notice to the Pune-based company for delays in deliveries, SII’s chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla told Business Standard on Tuesday.The company is a key supplier for the UN-backed Covax program that aims to distribute vaccines equitably in the world. On March 25, Covax announced a major setback in its vaccine rollout because a surge in infections in India caused the Serum Institute of India (SII) to cater to domestic demand, resulting in a delay in global shipments of up to 90 million doses.“AstraZeneca has sent us a legal notice (for delays in supplying the vaccine) and the Indian government is also aware of that. I cannot comment on the legal notice as it is confidential, but we are examining all avenues to amicably manage and resolve legal disputes over contractual obligations that Serum Institute is not able to fulfil due to its prioritisation of Indian supplies. Everyone has been very understanding so far. The government is evaluating what it can do to resolve the issue,” Poonawalla said.Also Read| ‘Outstretched’ SII chief seeks ₹3,000-crore fillip to boost supplyPoonawalla, whose company is the world’s largest vaccine maker, separately told AP that SII will be able to restart exports by June if new infections subside in India since the company has “chosen to prioritise India temporarily for two months”.He acknowledged that has put a “strain on our contractual obligations” to provide vaccines to other countries. “I’ve had to politely explain to everybody the situation,” he said, adding that most leaders understood as they were facing the same issues.If India’s surge in infections doesn’t subside, “I am scared of what ... we will have to do, and what will happen,” he said.(With agency inputs)\n",

              " ' AstraZeneca serves legal notice to Serum Institute over supply delays  AstraZeneca, the developer of the coronavirus vaccine being manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and sold as Covishield, has sent a legal notice to the Pune-based company for delays in deliveries, SII’s chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla told Business Standard on Tuesday.The company is a key supplier for the UN-backed Covax program that aims to distribute vaccines equitably in the world. On March 25, Covax announced a major setback in its vaccine rollout because a surge in infections in India caused the Serum Institute of India (SII) to cater to domestic demand, resulting in a delay in global shipments of up to 90 million doses.“AstraZeneca has sent us a legal notice (for delays in supplying the vaccine) and the Indian government is also aware of that. I cannot comment on the legal notice as it is confidential, but we are examining all avenues to amicably manage and resolve legal disputes over contractual obligations that Serum Institute is not able to fulfil due to its prioritisation of Indian supplies. Everyone has been very understanding so far. The government is evaluating what it can do to resolve the issue,” Poonawalla said.Also Read| ‘Outstretched’ SII chief seeks ₹3,000-crore fillip to boost supplyPoonawalla, whose company is the world’s largest vaccine maker, separately told AP that SII will be able to restart exports by June if new infections subside in India since the company has “chosen to prioritise India temporarily for two months”.He acknowledged that has put a “strain on our contractual obligations” to provide vaccines to other countries. “I’ve had to politely explain to everybody the situation,” he said, adding that most leaders understood as they were facing the same issues.If India’s surge in infections doesn’t subside, “I am scared of what ... we will have to do, and what will happen,” he said.(With agency inputs) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics serum institute ',\n",
              " ' Karan Patel angry with partial lockdown: \\'Stupid and outright senseless\\'  Actor Karan Patel has questioned the partial lockdown and restrictions imposed in Maharashtra, especially in wake of the political rallies that continue as usual, without following any of the Covid-19 safety rules.Karan took to Instagram Stories and wrote, “Actors CAN continue to shoot for their projects. Cricketers CAN continue to play their matches, day or night. Politicians CAN hold rallies with thousands of people States CAN conduct elections and expect you to come out to vote. BUT the common man cannot go to work. #Stupid and Outright senseless.” A screenshot of Karan\\'s post. Maharashtra is under partial lockdown, with night curfew and weekend lockdown imposed earlier this week and will remain in place till April 30. However, retailers, traders and a few other sectors have been protesting against the partial lockdown and the government is likely to tweak its standard operating procedures (SOPs), offering relaxations to a few sectors soon. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with them and hinted at the relaxations.Actor Nakuul Mehta also seemed to have similar views as Karan. He posted on his Instagram Stories, \"Political rallies - Not needed, Bollywood Awards Shows - Nah, Religious Gathering - No, Kumbh Mela - Deffo not BUT ALONE IN CAR - YAAAS!!!!!\" He was reacting to the new rule of wearing a mask inside the car in Delhi even when driving alone. A glimpse of Nakuul\\'s post. “The restrictions imposed are out of compulsion amid the second wave. Not only traders and business, even the state is facing losses to the exchequer. We will definitely reconsider the decision and offer some relaxation after a due deliberation with task force, police administration and other departments,” the CM said.Also read: Kangana claims Akshay, others messaged her secretly praising Thalaivi trailer SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics karan patel nakuul mehta lockdown 2.0 maharashtra + 2 more Related Stories The trailer of Kangana Ranaut\\'s Thalaivi was unveiled on her birthday in March. bollywood Kangana claims Akshay, others messaged her secretly praising Thalaivi trailer By HT Entertainment Desk PUBLISHED ON APR 07, 2021 10:39 PM IST Kangana Ranaut, in a new tweet, has claimed that while a number of big stars have congratulated her for Thalaivi trailer secretly, none will do in public because of \\'movie mafia terror\\'.

              " ' Refund passengers who cancelled flights in lockdown last year: Govt to airlines  The ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction over airline companies defaulting on refunds to passengers over flight tickets that were booked for travel during the lockdown last year but got cancelled.MoCA Secretary on Wednesday chaired a meeting with representatives of airlines in connection with refund of credit shells of passengers. A credit shell is a credit note created against a cancelled PNR and can be used by the passenger for a future booking.\"MoCA Secretary has chaired the meeting today with all the airline companies regarding credit shells refund and expressed dissatisfaction towards airline companies who did not refund the money. GoAir and IndiGo have submitted their undertaking to the ministry that they have refund all the credit shells to the passengers\", an official told ANI.The Supreme Court of India had ordered MoCA to clear all the credit shells and refund the passengers after the deadline of March 31.India\\'s low-cost airline SpiceJet wasn\\'t able to refund credit shells to the passengers, \"Refunds are governed by the order of the Supreme Court and we are adhering to those directions. SpiceJet had written to all its travel partners and agents in March 2021 to share details of pending credit shell PNRs so that the airline can immediately reverse the credit shell amount back to the agency ID,\" a spokesperson for SpiceJet said.National carrier Air India is also yet to refund total credit shells to the passengers. As per sources said Air India has to clear credit shells to around five lakh twenty-five thousand passengers which amount to around ₹2000 crore.\"Air India is committed to processing its pending refunds claims expeditiously. Dissemination of information regarding refunds is already initiated. Air India has cleared close to ₹1000 Crore from 1st April 2020 till date in India.

              " ' Covid-19 prevalence in UK dropped in March, but decline flattening off: Study  The prevalence of Covid-19 infections in England dropped steeply in March, a closely watched survey said on Thursday, but in a note of caution it also showed that the drop in infections had slowed.The REACT study, run by Imperial College London, found that infections fell by approximately 60% from the last study in February, with only 1 in 500 people infected.However, the study found that the speed of decline started to plateau in mid-March. Schools reopened on March 8, and Covid-19 restrictions will be loosened further next week, with the reopening of all shops and outdoor hospitality venues.\"We have seen a gratifying fall in infections since our last survey in February... This is hugely encouraging and shows we’re headed in the right direction,\" Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme, said.\"However, in our most recent data there has been a flattening off in the infection rate with an R (reproduction) number now around one. This shows that we need to continue to approach the situation with caution and keep sticking to the rules.\"Overall, national prevalence in England dropped from 0.49% in February to 0.20% in March.The REACT study is one of the biggest Covid-19 surveys of its kind in England, with over 140,000 volunteers tested in England between March 11 and March 30 in the latest round.The study found that the correlation between infections and deaths was diverging, possibly an effect of Britain\\'s Covid-19 vaccination programme, which has seen over 31 million people receive a first Covid-19 vaccine dose.\"These findings are promising and illustrate the significant impact that lockdown, combined with our phenomenal vaccination programme, is having on the prevalence of this dreadful virus,\" health minister Matt Hancock said.

              " ' UK variant of Covid-19 now most common strain in United States, says CDC  The highly contagious variant of Covid-19 first discovered in the United Kingdom has become the most common strain of the virus in the United States as cases continue to climb, a top U.S. health official said on Wednesday.The strain, known as B.1.1.7, was identified in Britain last fall and has since been detected in 52 jurisdictions in the United States, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters at a White House briefing.U.S. public health officials have urged Americans to get vaccinated as soon as possible in part to prevent new variants of the novel coronavirus from spreading.The United States has also detected cases of a variant first discovered in South Africa that is thought to be resistant to some Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. That strain has been found in 36 U.S. jurisdictions, according to federal data last updated on Tuesday.The United States is administering about 3 million Covid-19 vaccine doses per day on average over the past week, up 8% over the previous seven-day average, Walensky said.Vaccine supply has increased significantly in the United States in recent weeks as Johnson & Johnson has begun making millions of doses of its recently authorized shots. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have also recently boosted their vaccine production capacity.U.S. President Joe Biden has doubled his goal for shots administered in his first 100 days in office from 100 million to 200 million and urged states to begin giving shots to all adults by mid-April.Still, daily U.S. cases of novel coronavirus are averaging 63,000 over the past seven days, up 2.3% from the previous seven-day average, Walensky said.Walensky said that the CDC has identified a number of Covid-19 outbreaks tied to youth sporting events and that communities experiencing high case counts should avoid holding such events. Testing should also happen twice a week, she said.White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also told reporters that the U.S. government is expanding its community health center program, which it set up in recent weeks to help get vaccines into underserved communities.

              " ' Scientists call for new investigation into Covid-19 origins: Report  A group of international scientists called for a new investigation into the origins of Covid-19 on Wednesday after China and the World Health Organization (WHO) released a scrutinized report last week concluding that the virus most likely came from wildlife instead of a laboratory.Twenty-four scientists from Europe, the US, Australia and Japan issued an open letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, that analyzed steps to complete a more comprehensive investigation, as reported by The Hill.\"Calling for a full investigation into the origins of the pandemic by the best available means is not intended to point fingers at any one country. Its purpose is to leave no stone unturned in seeking to understand how this catastrophe began so we can prioritize efforts to address our greatest shortcomings for the benefit of all people and all nations,\" the letter read.The Hill reported that the letter, which followed a previous open letter criticizing the WHO report, pointed out that \"critical records and biological samples that could provide essential insights into pandemic origins remain inaccessible.\"The scientists requested a probe involving biosecurity and biosafety experts conducted either by WHO or another group of nations to study the origins of Covid-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019.The WHO report determined that the possibility the virus came from a lab was \"extremely unlikely,\" noting there was \"no record\" any lab had closely related viruses.Jamie Metzl, an author, senior fellow of the Atlantic Council, an international policy think tank and signatory of the scientists\\' letter, said the renewed calls for a more thorough investigation reflected the need for greater monitoring of and restrictions on what viruses can be studied in labs around the world.\"This is not about ganging up on China,\" Metzl said according to The New York Times.WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said later that the mission\\'s consideration of a possible lab leak was not \"extensive enough.\"Metzl said he couldn\\'t agree more and said that in the future, such a review should include US labs. But, he said, the pandemic is of utmost urgency and he wants to start right away with China.\"It absolutely makes sense to establish a global regulatory system overseeing aggressive work with dangerous or deadly pathogens everywhere,\" he said.India, last week, said that it fully supports the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom\\'s expectation that future collaborative studies will include more timely and comprehensive data sharing but raised concerns over China\\'s delaying tactics and lack of access to \"complete, original data and samples\".Tedros, who has been accused of complacency towards China, hardened his tone acknowledging the concerns about China\\'s refusal to share raw data about early Covid-19 cases.The United States, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia and Israel said in a statement that they \"fully\" supported the WHO\\'s efforts to bring an end to the pandemic, including understanding how it \"started and spread\".But they added it was \"essential that we voice our shared concerns that the international expert study on the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples\".US Department of State Spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday (local time) said that what is evident from Washington\\'s review of the report is that it lacks crucial data, it lacks information, and it lacks access. \"It represents a picture that is partial and, in our view, incomplete. That\\'s not just our view. Many other countries share that view,\" he said during a briefing.China has been criticised widely across the world for its role in the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected over 132 million people across the world. More than 2.8 million people have lost their lives to the virus, as per Johns Hopkins University. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus covid-19 world health organization + 1 more ',\n",
              " ' Brazil detects first case of South African Covid-19 variant  Brazil has recorded its first confirmed case of the highly contagious coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa, a fresh danger sign for a country already ravaged by the world\\'s worst daily death toll and scrambling to make space for burials.Scientists warned on Wednesday that yet another new variant could be emerging in Brazil\\'s inland city of Belo Horizonte.The Federal University of Minas Gerais said in a statement that two samples taken in the city included a previously unseen set of 18 mutations, including some in the same genes modified by the South African variant and Brazil\\'s already prevalent variant, known as P.1.The detection of additional variants adds to concerns that a brutal Covid-19 wave battering Brazil may keep breaking grim records for weeks to come. On Tuesday, the health Ministry reported a single-day record of 4,195 deaths, followed by another 3,829 fatalities on Wednesday.Sao Paulo, the country\\'s biggest city, on Wednesday said it would begin opening some 600 new graves per day, well beyond the record of 426 burials in a day on March 30. The city is also preparing plans for a \"vertical cemetery,\" a crypt with 26,000 drawer-like graves that can be built in 90 days once approved.The outbreak in South America\\'s largest country may overtake the United States to become the world\\'s deadliest, some medical experts predict.The woman in Sao Paulo state now confirmed as infected by the South African virus variant was first identified by the Butantan biomedical institute as a possible case of a new local variant. Further analysis confirmed it as the first known local case of the variant widely circulating in South Africa and elsewhere.Scientists fear a showdown between the South African variant and Brazil\\'s P.1 variant, both of which are more contagious and possibly more deadly than the original version of the coronavirus, worsening Covid-19 surges.\"It could be a huge duel,\" said Maria Carolina Sabbaga, one of Butantan\\'s coordinators for studying new variants. \"I think P.1 has already taken over. I\\'m not sure if the South African will overtake P.1, let\\'s see.\"The South African variant in studies appears to lessen protection from current vaccines.José Patané, a Butantan researcher, said the variant most likely arrived in Brazil after traveling through Europe toward the end of 2020.The first local diagnosis, a woman in her 30s in the city of Sorocaba, had not traveled abroad or come into contact with someone who did, indicating local community transmission, researchers said.SLOW VACCINE ROLLOUTA possible surge of the South African variant could further complicate Brazil\\'s slow vaccine rollout.Brazil\\'s Covid-19 immunization program is built around the vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and China\\'s Sinovac Biotech Ltd, which have proven effective against the Brazilian variant in preliminary studies, according to officials.Research released on Wednesday showed the Sinovac shot was 50% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in a study of nearly 68,000 health workers in Manaus, where the P.1 strain first emerged as the predominant variant. The results support preliminary findings of separate research reported by Reuters last month.Immunizations have been slow to ramp up in Brazil after the government dragged its feet last year in acquiring vaccines while other countries raced to secure supplies.President Jair Bolsonaro has shifted his tone on vaccines, touting shots he had until recently disdained. But the far-right former army captain still opposes social distancing and mask requirements that health experts see as essential for curbing virus transmission.Under pressure from business leaders desperate to vaccinate their workforces and reopen operations, the lower house of Congress approved a controversial bill to allow private-sector vaccine purchases. After the lower house concluded voting on amendments Wednesday, the bill will now go to the Senate for consideration.The proposal would allow businesses to acquire vaccines to inoculate their employees as long as they donate the same number of shots to the public health system. Under current rules, businesses could only do that once the country has fully vaccinated risk groups outlined in a national immunization plan. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus covid-19 ',\n",

              " ' AstraZeneca vaccine clot risk \\'very rare\\': EU regulator as nations battle surge  The EU\\'s medicines regulator said Wednesday that blood clots should be listed as a rare side effect of the AstraZeneca jab but the benefits continue to outweigh risks, as several countries battle fresh virus surges amid vaccine shortfalls.A number of nations have suspended the use of AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine for younger populations after it was earlier banned outright in several places over blood clot scares.The United Kingdom on Wednesday said it will adopt new medical advice to offer most people under 30 an alternative to AstraZeneca if possible, after reporting 19 deaths from clots among people who received the shot.The debate comes as countries from Germany to Ukraine and India face new waves of the virus that has now killed more than 2.8 million people.Governments are scrambling to secure much-needed vaccine doses, with Australia the latest nation to complain of shortages that it blamed on EU export controls.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said Wednesday that blood clots should be listed as a \"very rare\" side effect, encouraging countries to continue its use.The announcement came after the EMA examined 86 blood clotting cases, 18 of which were fatal, out of around 25 million people in Europe who received the AstraZeneca vaccine. Most of the cases were in women aged under 60.But EMA chief Emer Cooke said no particular risk factor had been identified and the clots may be linked to an immune response to the vaccine.\"The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing Covid-19 overall outweigh the risk of side effects,\" she told a news conference.\"It is saving lives.\"- \\'Plausible but not confirmed\\' -The World Health Organization\\'s vaccine experts on Wednesday echoed EMA\\'s findings, saying a causal relationship between the vaccine and blood clots was \"plausible but is not confirmed\".\"We believe the benefit-risk balance is very much in favour of the vaccine,\" said the WHO in response to an AFP query.AstraZeneca itself said two studies by British and European regulators \"reaffirmed\" that the benefits of its vaccine \"far outweigh the risks\".Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands are among countries not recommending the shot for younger people.Britain\\'s decision to offer an alternative jab if possible to most people under 30 came after data showed 79 blood clots and 19 deaths among people who had received one of 20 million AstraZeneca doses administered in the UK.AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine has been administered in at least 111 countries, more than any of its rivals, according to AFP data. It is being used both in wealthier countries and poor nations, largely as part of the Covax scheme to ensure equitable access to vaccines.The controversy surrounding the jab has marred a global vaccine rollout that will help countries emerge from a pandemic that has ravaged the world\\'s economy and subjected much of humanity to some form of confinement.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed support for a snap lockdown to stem rising cases, after decentralised measures failed to quell outbreaks.Hard-hit France imposed tighter measures this week, as French Open organisers announced the tennis tournament would be delayed by one week until May 30 in the hopes of accomodating more fans.Ukraine on Wednesday reported record new deaths and hospitalisations after tightening measures in the capital.Canada\\'s most populous province of Ontario was ordered into a four-week lockdown, while Qatar reimposed strict measures.India, which registered a 24-hour record of almost 116,000 new cases on Wednesday, said it too would rollout tougher curbs with new curfews in place in 20 cities, including the capital New Delhi.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro however doubled down on his opposition to lockdown measures, despite the country registering its deadliest day yet on Tuesday with more than 4,000 deaths.\"We\\'re not going to accept these policies of \\'stay home, close everything, lock down,\\'\" he said.- Amnesty slams hoarding -Australia was facing vaccine woes of its own, after just 700,000 of a contracted 3.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered.Prime Minister Scott Morrison blamed the EU for the shortages, accusing the bloc of \"strict export controls\".More than 694 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered globally, according to an AFP tally, with just a handful of countries leading the pack by a wide margin.Israel has inoculated 61 percent of its people with one dose, while the US has administered 33 percent with a first shot.Amnesty International said in its annual report that wealthy countries are failing a test of global solidarity by hoarding Covid vaccines.Echoing calls to help hard-hit nations, G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to extend a moratorium on debt interest payments for the poorest countries.Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, where around 60 percent of adults have received a first dose, health workers started rolling out the Moderna jab, the third approved after AstraZeneca and Pfizer.\"I\\'m an unpaid carer for my grandmother so it is very important to me that I get it, so I can care for her properly and safely,\" said 24-year-old Elle Taylor.

The EMA insisted that the benefits of the shot still largely outweigh the risks.Nevertheless, Belgium imposed a ban on administering it to younger people.“We will keep it this way for the next four weeks and reassess it then,” said Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke.

              " ' Caste clash between Brahmin and Rajput groups over control of pond leaves 5 dead  Bihar Police on Wednesday arrested Pravin Jha alias Ravan for allegedly killing five members of a Rajput family in the state’s Madhubani district on March 29, reviving memories of caste conflicts that were common in the state till even two decades ago.Jha, 30, who was captured on Wednesday from Nepal, was heading a private armed force called Ravan Sena, said Darbhanga range inspector general of police Ajitabh Kumar. The conflict, ostensibly over fishing rights, is believed to be the flash point in a simmering dispute between two upper castes, Brahmins and Rajputs.Five persons, including a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel, were killed by Jha and a group of 50 armed people at Mahmudpur village under Benipatti police station on March 29 in a fight over fishing rights in a local pond. The incident took place when people were celebrating Holi, when Jha and the group of men carrying firearms and traditional weapons like swords came near the house of one Ranvijay Singh and started firing indiscriminately. They also attacked people with swords, according to the first information report (FIR) filed by the family of the deceased.Police said the dominant Rajput community of the village controlled the pond, something that did not go down well with Jha and some Brahmins in the area.Kumar said: “On March 29, the group led by Pravin Jha opened fired on the family of Ranvijay Singh over an ongoing dispute over fishing from a pond between Mahmudpur and Gebipur villages. In the brutal attack, Ranvijay Singh and his cousin Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members, Rana Pratap Singh (assistant sub-inspector in BSF), Amrendra Singh (inter-state cricketer) and Rudra Narayan Singh, succumbed to their injuries a day later. Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently admitted to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.”Preliminary investigations by the police have revealed that the pond is owned by Sanjay Singh (brother of Ranvijay Singh), but that another group from Gebipur wanted to capture it. On November 20, two separate cases were lodged against Sanjay and Mukesh Safi (close associate of Pravin Jha) after the two groups clashed over the fishing rights. They filed cases against each other. Sanjay is currently in jail for cases under the SC, ST Atrocities Act as Safi belong to the Scheduled Caste community.Kumar said a case has been registered against 35 persons, including 18 Brahmins and 13 Rajputs, and dozens of unidentified accused. “So far, 14 accused have been arrested and sent to jail while one prime accused Navin Jha is still absconding,” he said.The incident has brought to fore the rivalry between the upper castes in Bihar. The state had witnessed more than six dozen caste-related massacres in 1990s but most of them were confined to central Bihar.There are scores of private armies raised by upper castes such as Rajputs and Bhumihars in Bihar — Ranvir Sena, Lorik Sena, Bhumi Sena, Kisan Sangh and others. The Ravan Sena of Benippati was raised in 2018 and is only the second militia of the Brahmin community; it used to operate largely in Madhubani. “Of late, it has become active on social media in some pockets of Gopalganj as well,” said a police officer on conditions of anonymity. Villagers said that Jha, who sported a big moustache, preferred the name Ravan.The other Brahmin sena, the Parshuram Sena, formed by dreaded gangster Santosh Jha, who broke away from CPI (Maoist) in early 2000, is believed to largely focus on extorting money from road projects. It has allegedly killed over a dozen engineers and supervisors in the last one decade. Santosh Jha, a sharpshooter, was serving a life term for the murder of two engineers and was being tried in about 20 criminal cases when he was shot dead on the premises of a lower court in Sitamarhi on August 28, 2018.According to his Facebook profile, Ravan was preparing to contest panchayat election and had already declared himself as Mukhiya or headman. Police officials in Darbhanga range said that the Ravan Sena chief was a former district president of Bajrang Dal. “After he floated Ravan Sena, it started playing an active role in local politics,” they added. The Bajrang Dal is the youth wing of the Viswhwa Hindu Parishad and affiliated to the RSS, the ideological parent of the Bharatiya Janata Party.Bajrang Dal district convener Aditya Kumar denied that anybody by the name of Pravin Jha was associated with the Dal. “He took part in 2017 Ramnavmi procession as a commoner. It is just possible that he might be using the name of Bajrang Dal to establish supremacy in the area,” said Kumar.A legislator of the ruling Janata Dal (United), Sanjay Singh,who visited the village after the killing as a member of the party’s fact-finding team, described Jha as a “ruffian, who indulged in extortion”.Madhubani SP Satya Prakash said only two cases were lodged against Jha in the district. “We are interrogating him for more details about him and his aides.”Rival parties alleged that Jha was also into bootlegging in the state where there is prohibition. “The locals informed us that he is also involved in illegal trade of liquor,” said RJD MLA Chetan Anand. However, the police said that no case related to this has been lodged against him. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The group focuses on tightening gun control measures.Chipman was a special agent for the ATF for 25 years. During his career with the bureau, he disrupted a gun trafficking ring that operated between Virginia and New York City and became special agent in charge of the ATF’s firearms programs, according to his biography on Giffords.“It is far too easy for violent people to get their hands on deadly weapons,” Chipman said at a September 2019 congressional hearing. “The American people overwhelmingly want Congress to act now to make their communities safer. Assault weapons are a class of semiautomatic firearms originally intended for military use designed to kill people quickly and efficiently. These weapons are often the weapon of choice for mass shooters.”Chipman would have to win Senate confirmation to assume the role of ATF director.

              " ' Centre, states face off over supply of Covid-19 vaccines  Several states said on Wednesday they will run out of coronavirus vaccines within days and requested the central government for replenishments, prompting a strong rebuttal from Union health minister Harsh Vardhan who accused three states – all under Opposition governments – of politicising the issue.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the state was left with 1.4 million doses, which would last only three days, and urged the Union government to prioritise shipments to the state, which is reporting close to 10 times higher number of new infections every day than the region with the next-highest numbers.Earlier, on Monday, CM Uddhav Thackeray wrote a letter to the PM asking permission to vaccinate all above the age of 25.The Union health minister issued a statement later on Wednesday evening, hitting out at what he said was attempts to “divert attention” from the state’s slow vaccination drive, and targetting Punjab, Maharashtra, and Delhi, all of which have asked for an expansion of the criteria for vaccination, something the Union government isn’t willing to do right away. “Doesn’t it seem evident that these states are trying to divert attention from their poor vaccination efforts by just continuously shifting the goal posts? Politicising such a public health issue is a damning indictment of certain political leaders who should know better,” said Harsh Vardhan in the statement that cited vaccination figures from Maharashtra, Delhi, and Punjab, which he said were lower than that of several other states.Later, the Union health ministry sent letters to Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab, asking them to take “immediate corrective action” to ensure doses are delivered to health and front-line workers. The letter carried the same figures as disclosed by Harsh Vardhan in his statement.The Union government on Monday asked all states to stop registering more people as health and front-line workers. This confrontation comes a day before a meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called with the chief ministers of all states on Thursday. The meeting is meant to take stock of the Covid-19 situation and the vaccination drive, especially at a time when the country is going through its most severe wave of infections yet.On Tuesday, speaking about demands to open up the drive, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the drive was aimed at controlling fatalities, and that vaccines were being prioritised for those who “need” it, rather than those who “want” it.This week, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, too, wrote to the PM seeking the 45 years age bar removed, while his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh made similar demands earlier in the month. Harsh Vardhan gave a break-up of vaccination data for the three states to suggest they had not delivered adequate doses to health staff, front-line workers, and senior citizens.According to figures analysed from the Co-WIN dashboard, Maharashtra has delivered the highest number of doses among all states at 7.4 million, although in per capita terms, it has delivered 60,788 doses per million people, slightly lower than the national average of 65,329.Among states with large populations, Kerala, Rajasthan, Delhi, West Bengal and Maharashtra are the top five states in terms of doses delivered per million people. Officials in five other states – Rajasthan, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, and Uttarakhand – separately told HT that doses were close to running out.Officials in some BJP-ruled states, too, said they had stocks left only for a few days. Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, Uttarakhand’s extended programme for immunisation officer (the nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccinations), said that around 130,000 doses were left, which were to last for two more days at the current rate of vaccinations. In Bihar, which has delivered the lowest number of doses per capita at a little over 24,600, some districts were asked to go slow on immunisations till the next tranche of 900,000 doses arrive.Similar concerns were raised by Odisha, where the vaccination in-charge, Bijay Panigrahi, said till Wednesday morning, the state had a total 534,000 doses left. “With the state vaccinating nearly 2 lakh (200,000) everyday, the doses would get exhausted by Friday unless Centre dispatches more vaccines,” he said. Panigrahi said due to shortage of adequate vaccines, the state was able to run only 755 vaccination sites against 1,200-odd on Wednesday.Vaccine supply concerns have also been sounded by the manufacturers. Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Tuesday that his company, which is making the Covishield vaccine (over 90% of all doses given in India till now are of this), “was very outstretched”.An analysis of production capacities show that between SII and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, India’s current capacity is around 75 million doses a month, or roughly 2.5 million a day. Over the last week, 3.1 million doses a day on average have been delivered across the country.In his statement, Harsh Vardhan singled out Maharashtra for its officials and leaders flagging possible shortage and criticised what he said was “misgovernance and utter casual approach of Maharashtra government in battling the virus”.“Today, Maharashtra not only has the highest cases and deaths in the country but also has one of the highest test positivity rates in the world! Their testing is not up to the mark and their contact tracing leaves a lot to be desired... The performance of Maharashtra government in terms of vaccinating healthcare workers and front-line workers is also not great.”“Maharashtra government needs to do a lot more to control the pandemic and the Central government will help them in all possible ways. But focusing all their energies on playing politics and spreading lies to create panic is not going to help the people of Maharashtra,” he added.Reacting to this, Balasaheb Thorat, state revenue minister and former state Congress chief, later said in a tweet: “Why was there no strategy or planning put into the logistics of the vaccine programme? Why is there both extremely high wastage & an acute shortage of vaccines? Perhaps PM (Narendra) Modi should focus more on running the country than running for elections.”The Union government separately gave a break-up of supplies and said Maharashtra has been sent 10.6 million doses, of which 9 million had been used. The government said another 743,280 were in the “pipeline”, which authorities said meant as being in transit.“The union minister Prakash Javadekar had asked us to double the vaccination numbers and had assured to provide adequate stock. We accepted it as a challenge and increased the daily vaccination to 450,000 from 300,000. However, we have started facing shortage of vaccine stock and have to shut down many centres across the state as there is no stock left there,” Tope said on Wednesday morning.Javadekar, on Wednesday, tweeted that the “central govt replenishes more vaccine than what is needed for actual use”.

I plan to use all the tools in my toolbox as aggressively as possible to protect American workers and businesses from unfair Chinese practices,\" the commerce secretary said.The Commerce Department had overseen the restrictions on China via an \"Entity List\" created by the Trump administration. It was responsible for broad national-security-based tariffs the United States imposed on steel and aluminum from key trading partners, including the European Union, as reported by Sputnik.Toward the end of his term last year, then-President Trump also went after Chinese social media and payment applications TikTok and WeChat, trying to force their sale to US entities. Those moves were later struck down by US courts.Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China\\'s military aggression in various parts of the world.

              " ' 95-year-old farmer urges others to get vaccinated, says ‘must protect ourselves’  Karnal resident Chaudhary Bichha Ram, 95, says that the Covid-19 vaccine has not only given him protection against the disease, it is also helping him lead a normal life. “I got to know that Covid-19 vaccines have been developed but did not expect to get it so soon,” Bichha Ram said. He was administered the first dose of the Covishield vaccine on March 19 at the Banso Gate primary health centre in Karnal.The reports of some beneficiaries battling side-effects were a cause of concern for the elderly farmer as well. “But I cannot stay away from my family, especially from my grandchildren, so I decided to take the vaccine to protect myself from the virus despite rumours about side effects,” Bichha Ram said.He lives with his family of six, including his son, two daughters-in-law, and two grandsons.His son, Ritesh Arya, 50, who is a farmer and also property consultant in Karnal, took Bichha Ram for a walk-in vaccination session.“The doctors and nurses were very supportive, and explained everything. As we were talking, the medics pulled up my sleeve and inoculated me quickly,” Bichha Ram said. He was also asked for a photo with the staff, being the eldest person at the centre to get vaccinated.Recalling how his family wsa forced to stay isolated in the past one year since the pandemic struck, he said, “Nature has its own ways, and nobody can change these rules. But we should protect ourselves. I am 95, but even I don’t want to die.” Interestingly, Bichha Ram has been an advocate of Ayurveda since he suffered a stroke in 2008. He said doctors and scientists “have done a wonderful job” with Covid vaccines. “It’s nonsense to say the vaccine is not safe, people should at least show respect for those who worked day and night to save mankind.”His family said that Bichha Ram has now become an inspiration for others.“If a 95-year-old man can come forward to take the jab, why should the others fear?” asked Meenu Arya, his daughter-in-law.So far, more than 2 million people have been vaccinated across Haryana, said Rajeev Arora, the state additional chief secretary, health.Of these about 310,000 frontline and health care workers have received the first dose, and about 157,000 have received the second dose. More than 1.54 million people in the above-60 and 45-59 categories have been vaccinated, Arora said.India opened up its vaccination drive to all people above 45 last week. The previous two phases of the drive — the first was aimed at frontline workers and the second at those above 60, or above 45 with comorbidities – were dogged by slow roll-out, teething problems, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation. But people such as Bichha Ram are a testimony to the importance of taking the jab. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' Covid-19: Urban hot spots drive surge, in greater need of jab scale-up  The second wave of the coronavirus disease in India is seeing an alarming rise in infections coming from cities, with a majority of daily new Covid-19 cases coming from urban centres, something that was last seen at least 10 months ago, during the first wave of the pandemic.The numbers, experts say, highlight the need to focus sharply on getting the disease under control by expanding the vaccination drive in urban areas, especially large cities.Nearly half (48%) of all Covid-19 cases reported in India in March are from urban areas, which are home to just 14% of the population, with cities having the largest proportion of new infections since June 2020, according to an analysis by Hindustan Times. In the first four days of April, a majority (51.9%) of new cases were reported from these urban areas.Also Read| As India records 126,260 new Covid-19 cases, curbs in more statesThe numbers are even more worrying when disaggregated at the city level. For instance, Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur together accounted for 59% of Maharashtra’s cases in the first four days of April. Add Chennai, Bengaluru, and Delhi to the mix, and the seven cities together accounted for 42% of India’s cases in the same period.Data analysed by HT shows that urban areas reported 1.5 times the cases reported from rural regions in the country in the first four days of April. These same areas reported 1.4 times the cases in rural areas in March. This distribution is similar to trends seen at the start of the country’s first wave from March to June last year.Experts said the numbers underline the need to prioritise the government’s vaccination efforts to urban regions and, in particular, focus on cities that are currently seeing a massive surge in infections to effectively combat the latest surge of infections. They also emphasised that expanding the eligibility for vaccination to include everyone over the age of 18 would further help to cover proportions of the population that are mobile, and thus likely to spread the disease further.Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University, said while poor testing and reporting in rural areas could be one of the reasons behind a bigger surge in reported numbers from urban areas, the infection is likely to spread faster in urban areas because of a higher population density. The shift in the burden of cases to urban areas, he said, requires a reorientation of the vaccination strategy with a focus on areas showing a bigger surge. “Maharashtra is showing a surge, Nagaland is not. So to say that only people above 45 will be vaccinated in both places, to me it really does not address the issue based on data and based on the flexibility and nimbleness that you need to demonstrate.”The urban-rural breakup was calculated by dividing India’s districts into three large groups – urban districts (less than 40% rural population), mixed districts (40% to 60% rural population) and rural districts (more than 60% rural population). The proportion of the rural population is based on the 2011 Census (the latest data available). District-wise data on the number of cases has been sourced from How India Lives.The classification is in line with how rural and urban districts are defined in the country. Of all new Covid-19 infections reported in April, 51.9% are from urban districts, the highest this proportion has been since June 2020 (when it was 67.2%). At the other end of the spectrum, rural districts constituted 33.6% of all infections in the month of April, their lowest share since June. From August to October last year, rural areas had a higher share of new cases than urban areas. It is not only in the distribution of cases that urban areas have rapidly overtaken rural areas in the past two months. They have also done so in terms of the spread of cases within their respective populations.Another reason for the surge, Jameel said, could be the mutant strains of the virus . “The only logical thing that explains the surge at this point after India having gone through a fairly long first wave is that the behaviour of the virus has changed. And the behaviour of the virus can only change if there are mutants. And I do believe that this is the reason why urban areas are now back again showing higher percentage of cases.”Also Read| PM Modi to interact with CMs on Covid-19 situation, vaccination strategy on ThursdayTo be sure, not everyone agrees with the strategy of expanding the pool of recipients of the vaccine. The government, for one, does not, and has indicated that it will stick to its defined prioritisation protocol for vaccination. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that given the slow pace of immunisation it is important to focus on the more vulnerable population. “The idea of vaccination is to decrease the number of people who die and the number of people who are hospitalised. It’s more important to immunise people who are at higher risk,” he said.But easing the eligibility criteria could itself boost numbers (provided supply isn’t a constraint). Jameel said that one of the purposes of vaccination is to also control the pandemic. “Even the UK has turned the tide with vaccines. There is enough data to look at. Vaccines have to be deployed at scale. You can’t let the pandemic run wild,” he said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics india coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' Cabinet okays ₹10,738 crore PLI scheme for solar modules, white goods  The cabinet on Wednesday approved ₹10,738 crore production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes for solar modules and white goods as part of the overall ₹1.97 lakh crore PLI series under the government’s plan to make India a global manufacturing hub.While ₹4,500 crore was allocated for manufacturing of high-efficiency solar modules, a ₹6,238 crore outlay was approved for white goods -- air conditioners and LED lights. The Union budget on February 1 committed ₹1.97 lakh crore under PLI schemes for 13 key sectors.The PLI series is an effort of the Narendra Modi government to synergise India’s resources to make it an international manufacturing destination and an important part of the global supply chain, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said after the cabinet meeting.Goyal said the seven PLI schemes already approved had received an encouraging response from investors. Scheme for electronic components and mobile manufacturing received 16 applications and ₹35,000 crore was already sanctioned. Similarly, pharmaceutical (raw materials) and manufacturing of medical devices received 47 and 14 applications, respectively.“Solar PV manufacturers will be selected through a transparent competitive bidding process. PLI will be disbursed for five years post commissioning of solar PV manufacturing plants, on sales of high efficiency solar PV modules. Manufacturers will be rewarded for higher efficiencies of solar PV modules and also for sourcing their material from the domestic market,” an official statement said.The PLI scheme for white goods shall extend an incentive of 4-6% on incremental sales of goods manufactured in India for a period of five years to companies engaged in manufacturing of air conditioners and LED lights, a second statement said. “Selection of companies for the scheme shall be done so as to incentivise manufacturing of components or sub-assemblies which are not manufactured in India presently with sufficient capacity. Mere assembly of finished goods shall not be incentivised,” it added.Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners, said, “The PLI scheme is expected to be a game-changer in India’s journey towards self-reliance and other national priorities such as job creation, attracting investments and increasing exports.”“Given the changing global dynamics, it is essential to enhance global competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing segment to gain a higher share of worldwide merchandise trade, while also reducing domestic dependence on imports.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Covid lapses at farm stir may hit 4 states  The ongoing farmer agitation on the outskirts of Delhi will continue despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country, senior leaders of the movement insisted, despite warnings from health experts and government officials that the thousands-strong protest could become a virus superspreader that impacts four states.Some leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said they will ask farmers to adopt precautions such as masks but many farmers at the protest sites of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur expressed disbelief about Covid-19 protocols, said farmers have “higher immunity”, and termed the virus a “government conspiracy”.“Farmers have higher immunity. In our protests since last year, not a single Covid-19 case has happened. Why are only the farmers’ protests seen as a Covid risk? Why are questions never raised over mass election rallies being held in Bengal, Assam and Kerala?” asked Balbir Singh Rajewal, a key member of SKM.Other leaders of the movement also said that events such as a march to Parliament in May and blocking of highways in April will continue as scheduled. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda general secretary Sukhdev Singh, however, said that social distancing will be implemented at protest sites.Hundreds of thousands of farmers have camped outside Delhi since November last year in protest against three controversial central laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy.When the agitation began, the first wave of Covid-19 cases was on the wane. But over the past two weeks, cases have surged across India, which is firmly in the grip of the second national wave, and experts warn that the farm gatherings – where hundreds of families live in cheek-by-jowl trawlers on the highway and where scores of young men and women huddle together – is potentially an unchecked virus hot spot. “Gatherings are increasing the chance of transmitting the infection and that’s why they need to be avoided,” said Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi.To be sure, the caution is not limited to farm events and extend to any high-density event such as religious events, or political rallies.Travelling back and forthThe farm protests are unique because they pose a health risk to four states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as cultivators from all these regions have flocked to the Capital’s borders over the past six months to support the agitation, and keep going back and forth from the protest site to their homes.“So far we have not encountered any Covid case at the protest site but we are concerned about those who visit Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi these days as they might pick up the virus from places outside the protest site,” said Swaiman Singh, a cardiologist from New Jersey who has been volunteering at the Tikri site. It was not clear, however, what level of testing was happening at the site, and whether asymptomatic cases may be going undetected.Of particular concern is Punjab, which has recorded a big spike in cases and deaths in the past two weeks.On Wednesday, the state posted 2,963 cases even as the government clamped night curfew and announced additional curbs, including a ban on political gatherings.“We have a rotational basis for the protests. Ten fresh protestors come every week to relieve 10 people already taking part in the protests. This will continue,” Rajewal said, describing a system that, experts believe, underscores the heightened risk.Punjab govt not worriedThe Punjab government said it had no plans to check the ongoing stir. “There is hardly any rally being done by the farmers and if they are getting together at any place, they are doing it for the genuine demands against the three black laws. We cannot say anything to them as it’s a matter of their future generations,” said Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu.The state health department also maintained there was no direct link between the stir and rising Covid-19 cases. “Our analysis reveals that 70% of cases reported this year are from urban areas. Only 30% are from rural areas that are hubs of farmer protests,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.Health experts said that farmers may have escaped the scourge of the virus so far because the current surge was driven by urban areas. But they warned that the protest may become a hot spot, especially because testing in the villages was inadequate due to a boycott call given by farmer unions.In Haryana, additional chief secretary, health, Rajiv Arora said the farmer gatherings were a cause for concern.“The situation is under control in Jhajjar and Sonepat, the two Delhi bordering districts where the farmers have assembled in big numbers. But it is certainly a cause of concern. Such gatherings can lead to a wider and deeper spread of infection, particularly in light of the fact that a big number of agitating farmers come from Punjab where the infection and mortality rate is very high. The back-and-forth movement of farmers can also contribute to spread of contagion,’’ he said.State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, said any congregation – political, social or religious -- would cause a rise in cases.“People neither appear for testing nor vaccination. If the virus is so dangerous, why did Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar address a condolence meet in memory of Rohtak MP Arvind’s father and why did deputy CM Dushyant Chautala hold a rally ahead of Holi in Palwal? Are the rules only for protesting farmers? We will continue our agitation until our demands are met,” said state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, Balbir Singh Thakan‘Higher immunity’In Uttar Pradesh, where farm unions have organised a number of mahapanchayats – large rallies where tens of thousands of farmers participate – farmers said they were not worried. Large numbers of cultivators from the state’s western districts joined the protests in January after farm leader Rakesh Tikait’s emotional appeal.At the headquarters of the BKU in Sisauli town of Muzaffarnagar district, also the birthplace of Tikait, farmers said their resolve to continue the protest was unshaken by the Covid-19 surge. “Our immune system is strong and virus poses no danger to us. The government shouldn’t think of enforcing curbs on us,” said Dheeraj Latoyan, a farm leader.At the three protest sites on the Capital’s borders, the crowds have thinned from the peaks of December-January but thousands remain camped on the highway, and enthusiastic about the future course of the stir.The majority of protesters don’t use masks or sanitisers, and the disbelief about the virus still persists. Several farmers said they do not need a Covid-19 testing facility.“There is no such thing as coronavirus. The government is again doing the same as they did during last year to harass the poor. Their curbs and curfews won’t deter the spirits of protesters,” said Sukhbir Singh, a farmer from Moga.Delhi government officials said they periodically set up Covid-19 test camps near the protest sites that are open to everyone. “We have also periodically set up help desks in the sites to encourage people to get vaccinated. We have ambulances reserved in the sites to help with any kind of emergency situation,” said a senior official.Delhi police officials, meanwhile, said they are not taking any chances. Rajiv Ranjan, DCP (outer-north), under which the Singhu border falls, said all personnel deployed at the sites have received at least a single dose of vaccine. “Almost all the police and paramilitary personnel deployed at the border are vaccinated with at least one dose,” he said.

              " ' Kumbh braces for crowds amid Covid-19 surge  Despite a raging pandemic, authorities in Haridwar are bracing for an influx of devotees to the Mahakumbh -- considered to be the largest religious congregation world over -- to participate in the Shahi Snan on April 12, officials said.Kumbh Mela officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat held a meeting on Wednesday, directing government officials to ensure all Covid-appropriate behaviour and protocols are followed during the shahi snan (holy dip in Ganga river).“As far as facilities are concerned for the pilgrims they are at par with any other fair. Owing to Covid-19 pandemic, strict implementation of Covid-19 norms is being ensured for the Kumbh. RT-PCR negative report is mandatory for all outside people entering the Kumbh Mela zone and strict checking is being done at border check post,” said Rawat.The month-long Mahakumbh began in Haridwar on April 1 amid strict Covid-19 restrictions, with chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat -- who was diagnosed with Covid-19 later -- assuring devotees that none would be “unnecessarily harassed in the name of Covid-19 restrictions”.The festival is being held despite concerns raised by experts that the month-long event, which is expected to be attended by 30-50 million people, could become a Covid-19 hotspot. The state only made a negative RT-PCR test mandatory for all those entering the state after the Uttarakhand high court stepped in.“We always make arrangements for the Kumbh in accordance with the largest estimated turnouts. So, we are well prepared to tackle any situation,” Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said. “But with the second wave of coronavirus infection getting stronger and the SOPs in force, we don’t expect huge crowds on the ghats on the Shahi Snan days,” Gunjyal told PTI.The ritual of shahi snan will be held on April 12, 13, 14, 21 and 27.Uttarakhand on Wednesday recorded 1,109 new Covid-19 cases, the state’s highest in 185 days.

              " ' UK advises limiting AstraZeneca vaccine in under-30s amid blood clot worry  British authorities recommended Wednesday that the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine not be given to adults under 30 where possible because of strengthening evidence that the shot may be linked to rare blood clots.The recommendation came as regulators in the United Kingdom and the European Union emphasized that the benefits of receiving the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks for most people — even though the European Medicines Agency said it had found a “possible link” between the shot and the rare clots. British authorities recommended that people under 30 be offered alternatives to AstraZeneca. But the EMA advised no such age restrictions, leaving it up to its member-countries to decide whether to limit its use.Several countries have already imposed limits on who can receive the vaccine, and any restrictions are closely watched since the vaccine, which is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to global immunization campaigns and is a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries.“This is a course correction, there’s no question about that,” Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said during a news briefing.Van-Tam said the effect on Britain’s vaccination timetable — one of the speediest in the world — should be “zero or negligible,” assuming the National Health Service receives expected deliveries of other vaccines, including those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.EU and UK regulators held simultaneous news conferences Wednesday to announce the results of investigations into reports of blood clots that sparked concern about the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The EU agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. Dr Sabine Straus, chair of its Safety Committee, said the best data was from Germany, where there was one report of the clots for every 100,000 doses given, although she noted far fewer reports in the UK. Still, that’s less than the clot risk that healthy women face from birth control pills, noted another expert, Dr. Peter Arlett.The agency said most of the cases reported were in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination, though it was unable to identify specific risk factors based on current information. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the UK, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.“The risk of mortality from Covid is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects,” said Emer Cooke, the EMA\\'s executive director.Arlett said there is no information suggesting an increased risk from the other major Covid-19 vaccines.In a statement, AstraZeneca said both UK and EU regulators had requested their vaccine labels be updated to warn of these “extremely rare potential side effect(s).”“Both of these reviews reaffirmed the vaccine offers a high-level of protection against all severities of Covid-19 and that these benefits continue to far outweigh the risks,” it said.The EMA’s investigation focused on unusual types of blood clots that have occurred along with low blood platelets. One rare clot type appears in multiple blood vessels and the other in veins that drain blood from the brain.“We are not advising a stop to any vaccination for any individual in any age group,” said Wei Shen Lim, who chairs Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. “We are advising a preference for one vaccine over another vaccine for a particular age group ... out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns.”In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the vaccine.Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, however, continued to use it.The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine\\'s effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic.Dr. Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine could have serious consequences.“We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said.In some countries, authorities have already noted hesitancy toward the AstraZeneca shot.“People come and they are reluctant to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, they ask us if we also use anything else,” said Florentina Nastase, a doctor and coordinator at a vaccination center in Bucharest, Romania. “There were cases in which people didn’t show up, there were cases when people came to the center and saw that we use only AstraZeneca and refused (to be inoculated).”Meanwhile, the governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot.“Put yourself in the place of citizens — it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters.The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain\\'s Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary.On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings.Officials in Italy and Spain also said Wednesday that AstraZeneca would be recommended for people over 60 years of age.After the EMA\\'s announcement, Belgium\\'s health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, declared a four-week ban on administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people under 56, but said that would have little impact on the vaccination campaign, since few from that age group are in line to get the shots this month.“For the vast majority of people the benefits of the Oxford AZ vaccine far outweigh any extremely small risk,\\'\\' said Dr. Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of Britain’s vaccination committee. \"And the Oxford AZ vaccine will continue to save many from suffering the devastating effects that can result from a Covid infection.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics united kingdom astrazeneca ',\n",
              " \" Former US Vice President Mike Pence memoir set for 2023 release  Former Vice President Mike Pence has a book deal. His autobiography, currently untitled, is scheduled to come out in 2023.“I am grateful to have the opportunity to tell the story of my life in public service to the American people, from serving in Congress, to the Indiana Governor’s office and as Vice President of the United States,” Pence said in a statement. “I look forward to working with the outstanding team at Simon & Schuster to invite readers on a journey from a small town in Indiana to Washington, DC.”According to Pence’s agent, David Vigiliano, “all major publishers” competed for the book, and the deal was worth “well into seven figures.” A top editor from a rival publishing house confirmed that amount. The editor was not authorized to discuss negotiations and asked not to be identified.Simon & Schuster announced Wednesday that it also signed Pence to a second book but did not immediately provide details. Pence is the first major Trump administration official to have an announced deal since the president left office in January, although former White House advisor Kellyanne Conway and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are among those reportedly working on books.At this time in 2017, former President Barack Obama; former first lady Michelle Obama; former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden; and former Secretary of State John Kerry were among the recently departed Obama administration officials who had agreed to book deals. Several top publishing executives have told The Associated Press that they were not interested in a Trump memoir, citing the siege of the US Capitol on Jan. 6 by Trump’s supporters. Publishers also have expressed wariness about other members of the Trump administration, worrying about a backlash from readers, authors and employees.A Pence memoir will likely be subject to similar tensions the former Vice President has faced since he refused then-President Donald Trump’s demands that he help overturn the election results. Among Democrats and others who opposed Trump, Pence is widely seen as Trump’s loyal and complicit ally. Meanwhile, Trump supporters, and Trump himself, denounced him for not intervening Jan. 6 in Congress’ formal certification of Biden’s presidential victory.The certification — which Pence had no power to change — was delayed for hours after hundreds of Trump supporters, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” stormed the US Capitol.Simon & Schuster Vice President and Publisher Dana Canedy said that Pence’s book would be “revelatory,” without specifically saying whether he would address the events of Jan. 6.“Vice President Pence’s life and work, his journey as a Christian, the challenges and triumphs he has faced, and the lessons he has learned, tells an American story of extraordinary public service during a time of unrivaled public interest in our government and politics,” Canedy said. “His revelatory autobiography will be the definitive book on one of the most consequential presidencies in American history.”A Simon & Schuster spokesperson declined comment on what Pence planned to say about Jan. 6, and referred back to Canedy’s statement.The signing of Pence comes three months after Simon & Schuster dropped a book by Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had supported the rally in Washington which preceded the overrunning of the Capitol. Simon & Schuster has published several anti-Trump books over the past two years, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s “The Room Where It Happened” and niece Mary Trump’s “Too Much and Never Enough.” Its other authors have included Trump supporter Sean Hannity; the candidate Trump defeated in 2016, Hillary Clinton, and Trump himself.Pence's book deal continues the former vice president's re-emergence since January. On Wednesday, he launched an advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, which will promote the Trump administration's record and could serve as a springboard for a Pence presidential run in 2024. The advisory board includes anti-abortion rights advocate Marjorie Dannenfelser and Ed Meese, who was President Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, and such former Trump administration officials as Conway, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

              " ' Funeral homes ready for rise in Covid-19 toll: MCDs  Ashish Mishraashish.mishra2@htlive.comNew Delhi Taking note of the steep rise in Covid-19 cases, and apprehending a similar rise in related fatalities, Delhi’s three civic bodies on Wednesday said they are prepared to deal with any potential increase in deaths.Authorities of the north, east and south civic bodies said they have resources to handle 450-500 Covid-19 fatalities (confirmed and suspected) every day across their 21 facilities — crematoriums and burial grounds.According to the daily health bulletin, the city recorded 5,506 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday and 20 deaths. The city recorded the highest single-day deaths on November 18 last year during the third wave of the infection in the city, when 131 people succumbed to the disease. As new infections and deaths peaked during the third wave, crematoriums struggled to cope with the increased fatalities. There were reports of people waiting outside crematoriums and cemeteries for five to six hours to conduct last rites. The Delhi high court, too, had asked the government to indicate steps it had taken to manage crematoriums and graveyards in the national capital.Covid-19 deaths have increased sharply in the national capital over the past few weeks, since the outbreak of the fourth wave.In the first week of March, the Capital recorded less than two daily deaths of the infection. This number jumped to 15 in the first week of April, giving rise to fears that the city’s crematoriums may struggle to meet demands, if the spike continues.“Seeing the current steep rise in Covid-19 cases, we cannot help but be apprehensive about the possibility of the death toll rising too. So, we have made standby arrangements. At Nigambodh Ghat, we have opened three more CNG furnaces. We have also added 16 cremation platforms,” Jai Prakash, mayor, North corporation, said.He said their crematoriums and graveyards can perform nearly 200 last rites a day.Data from the three civic bodies showed that there are 21 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (confirmed and suspected) are being cremated or buried.Of these, eight facilities are under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, eight under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).“We have eight facilities, including crematoriums and burial grounds, where Covid-19 bodies are disposed of. These facilities can handle 215 bodies per day. We have also made additional arrangements to perform last rites of Covid-19 victims,” Narendra Chawla, leader of the house, SDMC, said.He said that a new CNG crematorium, with two furnaces, was inaugurated in Green Park in February, and the facility can be converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility if required.Sandeep Kapoor, former chairman standing committee, EDMC, said the civic body has dedicated five crematoriums and graveyards for Covid-19 victims and added that there is no rush at any of the facilities so far.“We will increase the number of wood pyres if need be. We have also ample space available in graveyards and, so far, there is no cause to worry,” Kapoor said.Experts, however, say the city is better prepared this time around to keep the Covid fatalities low.“We still cannot be sure whether the disease is less severe this time around. However, the case fatality ratio is definitely lower now as compared to the first wave of cases (last March-April). This is because the hospitals were not well equipped back then; there was a shortage of PPE kits, beds, non-invasive and invasive ventilators.“The treatment protocol had also not been finalised — now we know what to do at what stage of the disease.

              " ' Opposition parties flay Punjab govt’s move to ban political gatherings  The Opposition parties on Wednesday slammed the Punjab government over its decision to ban all political gatherings till April 30. The Shiromani Akali Dal said the decision to ban all political gatherings was a direct fallout of the “resounding success” of its ‘Punjab Mangda Jawab’ rallies, adding that the Congress government had resorted to this step to prevent the “public anger from boiling over”. In a statement, SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema claimed the SAD rallies had been exposing chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s alleged false promises made to the people before last polls. “This has upset the plans of Prashant Kishore who has given the suggestion to ban public rallies to contain the damage being cause to the Congress,” said Cheema. The Aaa Aadmi Party said the ban on political rallies is an attempt by the Congress government to derail the farmers’ agitation at the behest of the Centre. “When cases were at a peak last year, the CM was taking out tractor rallies with party leader Rahul Gandhi in Punjab. Now the opposition is getting tremendous public response and the Congress is losing ground, so he has announced a ban on political rallies,” said leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema.

              " ' Centre pulls up Punjab, Maha, Delhi over poor vaccination rate  New Delhi: The Centre has written to Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi governments flagging below-par vaccination of eligible beneficiaries, including healthcare workers. In a letter to the principal secretaries of Punjab, Delhi and Maharashtra, additional health secretary Manohar Agnani on Wednesday said that the performance of these states and UT have been below the national average and needs improvement. They were urged to undertake necessary corrective actions immediately towards improving the performance of COVID-19 vaccination drive in their states and union territory. “I look forward to your unstinted support to the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive which is critical to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. Aganani’s letter comes after a strongly worded statement issued by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in which he hit out at Maharashtra and some other states, accusing them of trying to cover their “failures” and spreading panic among people by demanding vaccination of all without inoculating enough of eligible beneficiaries.

              " ' Andhra high court clears elections to local bodies  Elections to 534 Zilla Parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) and 7,621 mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) in Andhra Pradesh will be held as scheduled on Thursday. A division bench of the Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday dismissed the interim orders given by the single judge bench of the court on Tuesday stalling the elections to Zilla Parishad and mandal (block) parishads on the ground that the four-week period for the enforcement of model code of conduct was not being followed. Acting on a review petition filed by State Election Commissioner (SEC) Neelam Sawhney, the division bench heard the arguments of both the sides and gave the green signal to the commission to hold the elections as scheduled on Thursday. The division bench, however, ordered that the counting of votes should not be held on April 10 and results should not be declared. It referred the issue back to the single judge bench to settle the issue. Arguing on behalf of the SEC, senior advocate C V Mohan Reddy said the petitioner Varla Ramaiah of Telugu Desam Party had no locus standi to question the SEC’s decision as he was not a contestant in the elections. He also pointed out that the four-week time for implementation of model code of conduct was not made mandatory by the Supreme Court. It only gave a suggestion, while hearing the case in a particular context. If the code is implemented for four weeks, all the ongoing developmental works would come to a halt, he argued. In all, there are 660 ZPTCs and 9,984 MPTCs in Andhra Pradesh, of which as many as 126 ZPTCs and 2,363 MPTCs were elected unanimously during the beginning of the election process in March 2020.

              " ' Three Punjab ministers to meet Piyush Goyal over procurement, DBT standoff today  Three Punjab cabinet ministers will meet Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi on Thursday to resolve the standoff between the Centre and the state government over making land records mandatory for crop procurement and implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. State ministers Manpreet Singh Badal (finance), Bharat Bhushan Ashu (food and civil supplies) and Vijay Inder Singla (public works) along with Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh will also take up the issues of recovery of incidentals and demand for 3% rural development fund (RDF) for procurement in the previous kharif season. The state government claims RDF as its right, saying it is an important source of income for carrying out development works in rural areas.Punjab’s four procurement agencies led by the state food and civil supplies department have made arrangements for procuring 130 lakh tonne wheat by setting up 3,700 mandis to adhere to Covid-19 protocol of social distancing. The meeting is crucial particularly when the farmers from Punjab and other states are staging protests at the Delhi border seeking repeal of the Centre’s three agriculture laws. The Centre wants arhtiyas (commission agents) to be out of the procurement scene by depositing crop directly into the accounts of farmers through the public finance management system. On the other hand, the state government says arhtiyas play a pivotal role in the procurement process by charging 2% dami on the crop sale.“Procurement in Punjab can’t take place in the absence of arthiyas as they support the mandi operations by cleaning, weighing, filling, loading and unloading of crop,” said a food and civil supplies department official. “We got the appointment with the Union minister after several requests. We hope to resolve all the issues,” said Bharat Bhushan Ashu. On Wednesday, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh held a virtual meeting with the arhtiya association, Ashu and officials of the food and civil supplies department.The arhtiyas announced that they will shut the mandis operations from April 10 as a mark of protest if their issues were not resolved. “We will not let weighing and loading of the wheat crop in case the Centre is adamant to go ahead with DBT,” said VK Kalra, president of an arhtiyas association.

              " ' With 2 MLAs joining TRS, Telugu Desam Party loses its presence in Telangana assembly  The Telugu Desam Party, which hitherto had a nominal presence in Telangana, lost its existence in the state assembly completely on Wednesday, with both the MLAs of the party joining the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi. The two lawmakers – Sandra Venkata Veeraiah from Sattupalli assembly constituency and Mecha Nageshwara Rao from Ashwaraopet constituency (both in Khammam district) – wrote a letter to assembly speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy on Wednesday evening, stating that they were merging the Telugu Desam Legislature Party with the TRS. Subsequently, state legislature secretary Narasimha Chary issued a bulletin, acknowledging the merger and the two TDP legislators as TRS members. In the December 2018 elections, the TDP won only two seats in the 119-member Telangana assembly. With both these members joining the TRS, the TDP has lost its identity in the state. The strength of the TRS has now gone up to 103. The Congress has six MLAs, while the MIM has seven and the BJP two. There is one vacant seat, that of Nagarjunasagar for which by-election is being held on April 17. In fact, Veeraiah has already been moving closely with the TRS for the last two years but Nageshwara Rao has been loyal to the TDP so far. Now, he, too, has moved to the TRS. “I was forced to take the decision, because I realised there is no future for the TDP in Telangana. That is why, I submitted my resignation to the TDP and joined the TRS for the sake of the people of my constituency and their development,” Nageshwara Rao said, after meeting TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao at the latter’s residence Pragati Bhavan. He hoped that he would be able to do justice for his constituency as a TRS legislator. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' As Flipkart gets land for fulfilment centre, Amazon may follow suit  After a six-month holdup, the allotment of 140 acres to e-commerce company Flipkart for setting up its fulfilment centre in Gurugram’s warehousing and transport hub at Patli Hazipur, Manesar, by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) has opened avenues for e-commerce giant Amazon. Officials said they had already held a few rounds of discussion with Amazon and certain other e-commerce companies who evinced interest in buying such sites. After allotment to Flipkart, the corporation has about 60 acres of land in two disjointed chunks at Patli Hazipur left for sale. The site to Flipkart was allotted at ₹3.22 crore per acre at bare shell cost, thereby meaning HSIIDC would not provide either external or internal infrastructure for the site and creating it would be the responsibility of the allottee. Only infrastructure development charges which included cost of development of major infrastructure project like the KMP-e-way, which is next to this site, has been levied, officials said. Flipkart was originally allotted 140 acres in October last year but the handing over was delayed following objections by industries and commerce minister Dushyant Chautala who wanted the corporation to explore a better price for the prime site, initially allotted at ₹3.09 crore per acre at bare shell cost. The Haryana Enterprise Promotion Board (HEPB) headed by chief minister then asked the corporation to put a few more similarly situated warehousing sites for e-auction to explore the market. Four warehousing sites of comparatively smaller sizes were put up for auction, but there was zero response. Subsequently, the HEPB approved the allotment to Flipkart on Tuesday but at a slightly higher rate. “The problems in the Flipkart created a bit of confusion. But we had a series of interaction with Amazon team, and they have evinced interest in buying 40-acre land, adjacent to the Flipkart site,’’ said a top official. HSIIDC officials said that the Patli Hazipur chunk of land was at a prime location. It is located close to KMP expressway and Gurugram-Pataudi road. Thus, it’s ideal for companies who wanted to have better connectivity for movement of goods from warehouses to destination cities “Normally, companies wanted to set up warehousing space look for change of land use mode where they get the site at about ₹2 crore per acre. But bigger players like Flipkart and Amazon don’t mind spending more for such sites which are comparatively expensive but strategically situated. The KMP e-way is a mere five-minute drive away from this site,’’ an official said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

We have been providing anti-rabies vaccines and immunoglobulin free of cost to patients at the clinic,” he said.Dr Rather said the new effort is aimed at overcoming the drawback with sterilisation programme.“Earlier, the volume of sterilisations was low as we had limited infrastructure.

While medical students are struggling with practical surgical classes being held online, PhD students are unable to access labs in their host countries and the language barrier is getting worse while studying online,” said a statement released by these students.After spending a year back home due to the Covid-19 imposed lockdown around the world, the recent statement released by the Chinese government still gives no clear deadline on when the entry restriction for international students holding study visa ends. In a statement made public on March 22 by the Indian Embassy in Beijing, China, the embassy has clarified that the recent decision of the Chinese government related to visa facilitation for foreigners visiting China does not apply to foreign students. “Chinese authorities at various levels continue to maintain their position that, on account of last year’s announcement by ministry of foreign affairs of the People’s Republic of China to suspend temporarily the entry of foreigners holding valid Chinese visa and residence permits following the outbreak Covid-19 in many countries, the visa suspension on foreigners stays until further notice,” states the official statement released by the embassy.Students are now worried about their future. A third-year student from Jianghan University in Wuhan, said, “Most of us want to withdraw our admission from China and continue our education elsewhere. However, the National Medical Commission (NMC) of India mandates that we finish our course from the institute we got admitted to.” Apart from theory, colleges are now holding practicals online. “Our seniors are being taught surgery online,” she added.According to data from the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), in 2018 and 2019 China received around 500,000 international students each, the third highest in the world after the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Official data shows that in 2018, over 23,000 Indian students were enrolled in various programmes in China. Indians represent the fourth largest group of international students in China, after South Koreans, Thais and Pakistanis. “Many of us were scheduled to arrive to our host countries before the April term, and have been forced to leave our jobs, apartments and belongings in the host countries…Given the circumstance, it is wise to allow only essential travel and with proper care and quarantine, these host countries can easily bring back their students and allow us to pursue our education physically along with our batchmates from the host country,” said the statement released by students.

The death toll mounted to 2,018 as the UT recorded six fresh fatalities – four in Jammu division and two in Kashmir. Of the new cases, 465 were from Kashmir division and 347 were from Jammu. Of the total cases, 257 were travellers. J&K had recorded an all-time high on September 12 when 1,698 infections were reported in the UT.Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) president Nisar-ul-Hassan said the region was facing a second wave. “Second waves of pandemics have been seen to be harsher,” Hassan said, giving the example of 1918 Spanish flu.“Covid is following the same suit. The second waves of coronavirus in the United States and Europe were uniformly worse than the first. Kashmir is currently under the grip of a second wave and the cases are rising and hospitalisations, too,” he said.Officials said with 239 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 138 in Jammu district, 79 in Udhampur, 78 in Baramulla ,62 in Reasi and 42 in Budgam. Seven out of 20 districts reported single-digit cases. The number of active cases, which has been rising steadily since March reached 5,053, officials said. After the peak in the first wave in September, active cases had declined steadily as the year ended to reach a low of 593 on February 8 and 9. Since February 9, the UT has added 4,460 active cases in around two months.“If countermeasures are not put in place, we could end up having a situation that could be worse than what we saw last year.

And, after a couple of weeks, many of them are likely to infect the elder members of their family and when that happens, serious illnesses and deaths will go up,” he said.

              " ' Amid stir, Maharashtra may relax curbs for some sectors  After protests by retailers, traders and other sectors to the partial lockdown, the state is expected to tweak its standard operating procedures (SOPs), giving relaxations to a few sectors in the next few days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his meeting with them hinted at the relaxations. Two days after the partial lockdown was imposed, traders and shopkeepers took to the streets, protesting against the lockdown, as confusion and ambiguities over the guidelines led to chaos in the past two days. Thackeray later held meetings with the organisations representing retailers, traders and bodies representing chartered accountants and company secretaries on Wednesday. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte held a video conference with all district collectors and civic commissioners to clarify about the confusion. Thackeray has assured the retailers he would reconsider the decision of shutting shops and offices in the next two days. “The restrictions imposed are out of compulsion amid the second wave. Not only traders and business, even the state is facing losses to the exchequer. We will definitely reconsider the decision and offer some relaxation after a due deliberation with task force, police administration and other departments,” he said. Thackeray also warned retailers and traders to ensure the guidelines are followed. “If there are 1.5 million workers employed in the shops and establishments in Mumbai, their mobilisation leads to the risk of spread of the virus. Similarly, the movement of people engaged in other sectors will also lead to crowding,” he said. The associations representing traders told the CM that the sentiments of their members are extreme. “We pointed at the contradiction in the decision of lockdown as hawkers are allowed, while shopkeepers have to stay shut; industries are open but raw material vendors are shut. We are ready to keep the shops open in staggered timings and on limited days,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade. Thackeray also held a meeting with representatives of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and Institute of Company Secretaries of India and told them to submit an SOP that will help in the maintaining staggered timings and encouraging culture of work from home. Kunte took stock of the situation in various districts. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who held meetings with some of the trade bodies, too had demanded to revisit the decision of the partial lockdown as it has badly hit the economy.

              " ' Maha active cases may cross 1.1mn by April  The number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra is likely to cross the 1,100,000 mark by April 30, without adequate measures to control the spread of the virus, such as imposing restrictions on movement or business, according to the state health department. These figures are significant because the highest number of active cases in the entire country was around 1,100,000 during the previous wave of Covid-19 in September 2020, Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary of the state health department said on Wednesday. The issue was discussed during a video conference with the central government on Wednesday morning, Vyas said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also urged citizens to strictly follow restrictions imposed by the state government during the past few days, wear face masks in public places, and maintain social distancing. During an interaction with the media on Wednesday, Thackeray said, “It is important to create awareness about the real situation of Covid-19 on ground, so citizens can be careful and reduce stepping out. Many businesses are urging the government to allow them to operate as usual. We do not want to hamper any business or inconvenience citizens. We want to reduce non-essential commute and crowding at public places to control the spread of the infection.” According to the state’s original projections, Maharashtra would have crossed 472,000 active Covid-19 cases by April 12. However, Maharashtra has already crossed this figure as of Tuesday. “Our second wave began around February 11. Now, we are recording more cases than we predicted. The state has already recorded 50% more active cases during this wave, in comparison to its previous wave in September 2020. If cases increase in this proportion, by April 17, we will have around 568,000 active cases,” Vyas said. The maximum number of active Covid-19 cases in September 2020 was around 300,000, as opposed to 472,283 as of Tuesday. To streamline availability of beds for needy Covid-19 patients, health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday directed all district collectors and municipal commissioners to adopt Mumbai’s model of centralised bed allotment. “We have noticed patients struggle to find beds and approach individual hospitals to check availability. Beds will be allotted to Covid-19 patients through a centralised system at every district and municipal corporation level, so patients don’t have to run from one hospital to another,” Tope said.In the state, 80.51% Covid-19 beds, 32.77% oxygen beds and 60.95% ICU beds are occupied. Vyas said, “Overall the state has sufficient beds. However, some cities such as Nagpur, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Latur and Yavatmal are facing a bed crunch. We will increase infrastructure.” Maharashtra will start purchasing oxygen from neighbouring states in the coming days, to meet its oxygen demands for critical and serious Covid-19 patients. Maharashtra government produces 11,500 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day of which about 850 MT is used per day at present, but is likely to utilise its entire stock per day within a week. Tope also announced that the government is mulling capping retail price of the drug, Remdesivir, which is sold at as high as ₹4,000 per injection at present, while manufacturers sell every unit at ₹800 to stockers. This price is likely to be capped at ₹1,200. The state has requested the Centre to supply 4,000,000 vaccine shots to be able to meet its target of vaccinating 600,000 beneficiaries per day.

              " ' Maha lockdown: Fearing return of woes, migrants rush back to hometowns  Vishal Kori, 25, is perturbed by the memories of last year’s Covid-19 lockdown, when he had to walk for 10 days to his native place Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. He was among the millions of migrants, the bulk of Maharashtra’s workforce from March-end onwards, who trudged for days together, braving the scorching summer heat to reach their destinations. However as the Covid-19 pandemic subsided, these migrants made a comeback after some months. According to the state, at least 1.2 million workers from states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha left Maharashtra after the lockdown was announced on March 24. This time as the mini lockdown is imposed, Kori wants to take no chance as he stands in a railway ticket queue to go back to his native village. “I am not taking any chance as Mumbai faces a large number of Covid-19 cases and my shop is shut. It is better I go back fast before things turn ugly,” said Kori, who works in a footwear shop. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government imposed a mini lockdown from Tuesday in view of the surge in Covid cases, which has now reached above 50,000 per day across the state. “Mumbai is not safe anymore and it is better I go back to Jharkhand. I don’t think I will come back again as I will search for a job in Delhi or Noida,” said Jamal Khan, 44, a chef in a hotel in the city. Traders, especially in the hospitality sector, are worried. Mirah Hospitality, which runs 14 hotels including Rajdhani, Hitchki and Bayroute in Maharashtra, which was currently operating with 650 staff members, has seen 300 workers going back to their native states. “There is no way we can stop them. Some of our staff are trying for jobs in Bengaluru and Delhi,” said Aji Nair, COO (food and beverages division), Mirah Hospitality. Currently the government has allowed hotels and restaurants to only offer parcel services which has paralysed this sector. The Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), which represents the traders, called it a sorry state of affairs. “Our members are trying their best to dissuade these workers from going back. However if the government continues with this mini lockdown and does not allow us to open our establishments, there is no way we can retain them. This loss of labour will hurt the state’s economy,” warned Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT. “We were barely recovering when this mini lockdown was imposed. We have taken loans and paid our license fees in advance,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, spokesperson, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI). SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

This decision was taken by Chahal with chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in order to give certain relaxations. Along with this, movement of maids and house helps is also allowed between 7am and 10pm on all days of the week.Currently, e-commerce delivery is allowed between 7am and 8 pm and for restaurants takeaway/home delivery is permitted between 7am and 8pm on weekdays.

              " ' Cases may start to dip in city post April 20: BMC chief  As the city is under a mini lockdown with the shutting of non-essential shops, malls and religious places, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained that this will help in controlling the spread of the virus. According to BMC, the number of cases being reported daily might stabilise within the next 10 to 12 days, and a downward trend might start post April 20. However, it will be dependent on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by citizens, BMC officials added.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told HT, “If we look at the current scenario in the city of a second wave, the daily cases being reported in the city have almost stabilised between 8,000 and 11,000 daily cases. If this trend continues, cases will start going down post April 20, but this remains only if citizens continue to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”Chahal added, “Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccines for those eligible are the two most important things for citizens to follow. We need to undertake Covid-19 vaccination on the lines of polio vaccination, and for this we are trying to mobilise citizens. The BMC is yet to get permission for door-to-door vaccination, and hence I have requested elected representatives from the city to mobilise citizens for Covid-19 vaccination.”The city has reported increased cases since February 10, from the earlier below-500 cases. Mumbai’s daily cases went up to 1,000 by February-end, 5,000 by March and around 10,000 cases by the first week of April. The positivity rate has gone up from 5% to around 26% by the first week of April.Experts said the number of cases can go down in the next two to four weeks. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “In case of Mumbai, we are looking at different timelines. My assumption is that the situation should improve in the next two to four weeks. But citizens need to behave in a Covid-19 appropriate manner, and asymptomatic patients need to understand and not block a bed.”Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of Microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “With so many restrictions, the caseload should go down in the coming days. However, we need to ensure no crowding in local trains, buses.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' ‘Class 9, 11 students to be promoted without exams’  Class 9 and 11 students in state board schools will be promoted to the next class without giving exams, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad declared on Tuesday afternoon. The decision is still awaiting a nod from the office of the chief minister. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Gaikwad said that in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases and the resultant school closures, it has been decided to promote Class 9 and 11 students without conducting assessments or exams this year. “While schools and teachers continued teaching students online and extended a lot of learning support even offline, the year has been tough for students as schools have remained closed for most of it. It is thus decided to promote students to the next class this year so as to ensure that they do not suffer due to the pandemic and the resultant learning losses,” stated the minister in the statement. Earlier this month, the education department had decided to promote students of Classes 1 to 8 to further classes under the no-detention policy under the RTE Act. However, for Class 9 and 11, schools and junior colleges usually hold exams and students who fail to clear these exams and the following reexams are detained in the same class. This year, however, owing to the pandemic and the resultant learning losses, students will not be detained under any circumstance and shall all be promoted to the next class, as per the minister. Meanwhile, the minister stated that there is a demand to conduct online exams for Class 10 and 12 and to postpone them due to rising infections in the state. “However, students from rural parts of the state are demanding offline exams as many of them have issues with respect to connectivity. Similarly, postponing exams might have an impact on students writing their competitive exams as other boards like CBSE and ICSE still have their offline exams scheduled. We will take the interest of all students in mind before coming up with any change in the decision,” stated the minister. While the HSC (Class 12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, 2021, SSC (Class 10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 33 lakh students appear for Class 10 and 12 exams from the state board every year. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Bombay HC grants police protection to sexual abuse survivor, friends  Raising concerns over the threat to the lives of survivors of sexual assault and witnesses in light of the situation in Uttar Pradesh, the Bombay high court (HC) said it did not want the situation to be repeated in Maharashtra, and hence directed the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) of Mira-Bhayandar Police to provide protection to a sexual assault survivor who had approached the court seeking the same. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing a plea by the survivor on Tuesday, was informed by advocate Trupti Bharadi that her client hailed from Rajasthan and that she was forced to work in a dance bad in Mumbai by her parents in 2011, when she was 17 years old. Bharadi further submitted that thereafter her client, her three sisters and four minors were forced into prostitution and were also sent to Dubai on three occasions between 2012 and 2014 by an agent. Bharadi claimed that after the survivor came to know that she was pregnant in March 2020, her father threatened to kill her if she refused to continue with prostitution. She continued with the pregnancy and gave birth in August 2020. However, due to the threat from her father, she left his house and started living with a friend. Her father then allegedly sent two people to coerce her into going back into prostitution in December last year, following which the woman filed a non-cognisable complaint with Bhayandar police. Her father allegedly also threatened her friend, prompting the friend to lode police complaint against the father at Kashimira police station. However, Bharadi claimed, the police did not take any action on the complaints, and hence her client approached the court seeking directions for registration of a case and for providing police protection to them. Additional public prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde for the police submitted that a first information report (FIR) was registered under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Immoral Trafficking Act against the woman’s parents. Shinde further added that as a new investigating officer had taken over the case, and he would require some time to investigate the matter. Shinde said the officer would submit the report before the court after two weeks. Responding to this, advocate Bharadi said some persons who had allegedly committed the offences were not made accused in the case and added that their should also be added in the FIR. He further urged the court to monitor the investigation and provide protection to the complainant and her friends who supported her till the names are added in the FIR. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “We know what is happening Uttar Pradesh; witnesses are killed. We do not want that situation in Maharashtra.” While the court allowed the police to investigate and submit a report, it held that it was necessary to provide police protection to the petitioner and witnesses free of charge till further order. The court also sought a compliance report in the next hearing on April 26. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' 4 farmers arrested for attack on Kurukshetra MP Nayab Saini  Karnal A day after the windshield of Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Kurukshetra Nayab Saini’s car was damaged during a protest by the farmers in Shahbad, four people were arrested on various charges, including attempt to murder. They were produced in a court and sent to judicial custody, police said. The police did not disclose the details of those arrested but a statement issued by the Kurukshetra SP’s office claimed that 15 people were booked under sections 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 307 (attempt to murder) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC for the attack on Saini who was escorted out unharmed though. The police action ruffled the farmer community and hundreds of them reached Shahbad police station and staged a dharna. Farmers threatened to intensify their agitation if those arrested were not released at the earliest. Farmers laid siege to the main entrance of the police station amid heavy police deployment. BKU spokesperson Rakesh Bains said they asked the police to release innocent farmers who have no role in the attack. He said the government was misusing power and using police to suppress their agitation. Farmers have formed a five-member committee for holding talks with the police. Kurukshetra SP Himanshu Garg did not respond to the phone calls and text messages sent to him. On Tuesday, MP Saini had visited Shahbad when BKU (Charuni) activists blocked his way and showed black flags. The MP’s car was escorted out after its rear windshield was broken.

              " ' Amid Covid surge, wait for beds in hosps gets longer in Lucknow  LUCKNOW Steep rise in fresh Covid cases has increased the waiting time for beds in city hospitals, which are now planning to take measures to overcome the crisis over the next few days.In March, the average time taken for a Covid patient to be admitted to hospital was one to two hours, after being allotted a hospital by health officials. But with the spike in cases, the allotment and admission is taking 5 to 7 hours. Sometimes, it’s even more, leaving many in the lurch, said attendants of patients.A 55-year-old woman from Sitapur Road had to wait till 4 in the morning before she could get a bed in a hospital after her Covid sample tested positive at 1am. Despite all efforts by doctors, she could not survive. “Her sample was taken at 5pm and the report came at 1am. Despite being in isolation, she had to wait for hours in a serious condition. She was admitted and doctors made every effort, but she lost her battle for life,” said a relative.On Wednesday, Lucknow reported the 1,333 fresh Covid cases, the highest in a day so far while UP logged 6,023 new cases. The state and the city also reported 40 and six Covid deaths, respectively.As per statistics, the number of ICU beds is insufficient (475 operational beds for 8,852 active cases). “To reduce mortality, public movement must be curbed immediately. This infection multiplies geometrically, hence 2,000 new cases can come in just two days. With a human-to-human spread pattern of this virus nothing will work other than controlling the movement of the people,” said a senior faculty of a medical institute. A health official said, ‘The bed capacity in hospitals should have been doubled as the virus is more infectious now. The central government has already conceded that the second wave is infecting more people than the first wave.” Earlier, the SGPGI had operated 201 beds with an additional 30 in the holding area till the cases had started subsiding. This time, the institute already has 210 beds (nine more than last year) in the main hospital and 40 in the holding area (10 more) where 146 patients are currently admitted. In wake of the Covid surge, PGI officials plan to take the bed strength to 300 in the main hospital over the next 15 days. Similarly, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences has 200 beds where 130 are high dependency unit (HDU) beds and 20 ICU beds, as per the data on Wednesday morning. The institute is now increasing the numbers. “We are adding beds for Covid facility from today and shortly 150 ICU/HDU beds will be available for patients,” said Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson for the institute. At the King George’s Medical University (KGMU), 293 ICU beds are operational. “We have 272 patients in the ICU and 36 in isolation at present,” said Dr Sudhir Singh. The total strength of KGMU Covid facility is of 504 beds that it had used for patients during the first wave. Against a total 3,914 beds (including 2,781 isolation beds, 698 high dependency unit (HDU) beds, and 435 ICU/ventilator) at 32 government and private hospitals in October, the present strength is 2,225 in Lucknow including 1,121 isolation, 629 HDU and 475 ICU beds. BOXMed institutes asked to increase bed strengthLUCKNOW Medical institutes have been asked to increase the number of beds in their Covid wards, including ICU beds with ventilator support. In a letter, Alok Kumar, principal secretary (medical education), asked all government, private medical colleges, KGMU, SGPGI and other super-speciality institutes to increase bed strength. “With the surge in Covid cases it is important to enhance facilities for patients. Hence, the institutes/facilities where bed occupancy in Covid facility has been over 60% should expand their facilities to a maximum limit,” stated the letter. The letter particularly mentions Lucknow, where the case positivity rate is high. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Mamata Banerjee draws EC ire for remarks on minority votes, poll body sends notice  The Election Commission of India sent a notice to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday for allegedly urging the minority community not to allow a split in their votes and demanding votes on communal ground. This comes a day after PM Modi had said from a public rally that he was not sure whether the ECI had sent any letter to Mamata Banerjee for appealing to the Muslim population and urging them to prevent their votes from getting split.The poll panel has given the TMC chief 48-hours to respond, failing which the ECI may take a decision without any further reference. A BJP delegation in Delhi led by Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had lodged a complaint with the poll panel earlier this week alleging that on April 3, Banerjee had appealed to Muslim voters not to let their votes be split among different political parties and openly demanded votes on communal ground for the TMC. “The commission gives you an opportunity to explain your stand in making the statement within 48 hours of receipt of the notice, failing which the commission shall take a decision without further reference to you,” the notice stated. Banerjee had appealed to the minority community not to divide the minority votes from a rally at Tarakeshwar in Hooghly district on April 3. “I appeal to my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands. Don’t split the minority votes listening to the devil, who is moving around with BJP’s money. He makes many communal statements and triggers clashes between the Hindus and Muslims,” Banerjee had said while addressing the rally. The poll panel said in its letter that Banerjee’s statement was examined and was found to be in violation of the provisions contained in Section 123(3), 3(A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and also clauses 2,3,4 of Part 1 of General Conduct of Model Code of Conduct for the guidance of political parties and candidates. “Mamatadi issued notice by @ECISVEEP on @BJP’s complaint. What about TMC complaints of 1. Video evidence of BJP candidate distributing cash 2. Cash coupons distributed to attend BJP mtng & vote. Gentlemen - at least keep up the farce of impartiality!” Mahua Moitra, TMC MP tweeted on Wednesday evening. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in an election rally in north Bengal that the TMC chief’s appeal to the Muslim population not to divide their votes indicates that she has lost their support, “Dear Didi, recently you said all Muslims should unite, and not allow their votes to be divided. You are saying this means that you are convinced that the Muslim vote bank has also gone out of your hands, the Muslims have also turned away from you,” Modi had said. He had also said: “If I had urged Hindus to unite and vote for BJP, the ECI would have sent me 8 to 10 notices. The poll panel sends notices to the Prime Ministers too. It would have made front-page news and all sorts of editorial pieces would have been written to tear me apart. I don’t know whether the ECI has sent any notice to didi,” Modi had said on Tuesday while addressing the same rally. “This is not a big issue. Mamata will reply within 48 hours. Such incidents happen during elections. The ECI doesn’t have the power to behead someone or disqualify a candidate. They have raised objection, Mamata will explain,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.

              " ' NIA court extends Sachin Vaze’s custody, permits CBI to grill him  The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday extended custody of suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze till April 9 in connection with his alleged role in parking an explosives-laden car outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February. The special court also permitted the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to interrogate Vaze in connection with the preliminary probe directed by the Bombay high court (HC) while he is in NIA custody. The special court also remanded former police constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor, booked for their role in Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s murder case, in judicial custody. NIA while seeking Vaze’s custody argued that they needed his custody to unearth the cash trail, source of procurement of gelatin sticks which were planted in the car found outside Ambani’s residence as well as the motive behind murder of Hiran. The agency on Wednesday informed the court that there is ₹1.5 crore in Axis Bank in the name of a company floated by the accused. The agency also claimed that Vaze had given ₹36 lakh and ₹40 lakh to his accomplices. He had also allegedly purchased six high-end vehicles. “We need to know the source of money; was he extorting money for himself or for others? How does an assistant police inspection rank officer have such a huge amount in his account?” the NIA said. The agency also claimed that it was a deep-rooted terror conspiracy, and hence they have to probe if the money found in Vaze’s account was used to procure the gelatin sticks and where it was sourced from. “More time is required to unearth the cash trail, existing accounts of the accused and whether this money has direct connection with gelatins,” NIA said. In the Mansukh Hiran murder case, the agency claimed that Vaze and other accused had hatched the conspiracy to eliminate Hiran on March 2 and 3. “Hiran was a co-conspirator in the explosives case and has been eliminated. The accused has direct connection with the case. NIA needs to find motive behind his murder,” the probong agency stated. Meanwhile, the NIA court on Wednesday allowed CBI to question Vaze in connection with preliminary enquiry initiated on the allegation made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. The CBI team from Delhi approached the special court in connection with the preliminary enquiry directed by the Bombay High court on April 5. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' NIA grills Param Bir Singh, Pradeep Sharma in Antilia bomb scare and Hiran murder cases  The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been probing the Antilia bomb scare and the murder case of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, questioned former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh for four hours on Wednesday. Encounter specialist and former police personnel Pradeep Sharma was also questioned for seven hours at NIA office in south Mumbai. Singh reached NIA office around 9.30am. NIA recorded his statement in connection with the Antilia bomb scare case as he was the Mumbai Police commissioner and arrested accused Sachin Vaze, who was then in-charge of the crime intelligence unit (CIU), was allegedly directly reporting to Singh. Soon after the explosive laden-Scorpio vehicle was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, the case was transferred to the CIU and Vaze was made an investigating officer. Singh has been appointed as the director general of Home Guards after he was shunted out from the post of Mumbai Police commissioner on March 17 after NIA claimed that Vaze was the mastermind behind planting the explosives-laden Scorpio near Antilia and seized an Innova of Mumbai Police which was allegedly trailing the Scorpio on February 25. Sharma reached NIA office around 12.45pm and left around 8.20pm. During an investigation, NIA found that Sharma had visited the Mumbai Police commissioner’s office on March 2 and had allegedly met Vaze in CIU office and also met Singh. NIA has been questioning him to find out whether he was involved in the meeting and whether he was part of the conversation with Vaze and Mansukh Hiran when Vaze was reportedly asking Hiran to take responsibility of planting explosives in his own Scorpio. Hiran, who was allegedly not ready to accept the responsibility, went missing on March 4 evening after he left his house to meet an officer named Tawade near Ghodbunder Road in Thane. Later on March 5, Hiran’s body was found near Retibunder in Mumbra. The probing agency is now conducting an investigation to find out if Vaze was involved in Hiran’s murder and whether he took help of others to execute his plan to frame or eliminate Hiran. Apart from Vaze, former police constable Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gor are in NIA’s custody for allegedly providing logistic support in Hiran’s murder. Sharma was a senior inspector of anti-extortion cell in Thane before he resigned from the police department in July 2019 and joined the Shiv Sena. He contested and lost in 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections from Nallasopara constituency against Hitendra Thakur. Sharma was previously suspended from police department owing to corruption allegations but was reinstated in 2005. He was also named in Ramnarayan Gupta alias Lakhan Bhaiya encounter case and was arrested in 2010, but was acquitted in 2013 by a lower court. He re-joined the Mumbai police force in 2017 and was in-charge of anti-extortion cell (AEC) in Thane when Singh was Thane commissioner. NIA officers also recorded statement of a deputy commissioner of police of Mumbai Police’s crime branch who visited the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3. The agency wanted to verify certain details with all concern people present in the CIU office at the time when Hiran met Vaze. The DCP visited the NIA office on Tuesday afternoon and he was examined for around three hours. He left the NIA office in the evening, said an NIA officer. However, a senior Mumbai Police officer said the DCP had visited the CIU office for some other work and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.As of now, NIA has recorded statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in both the cases, said an NIA officer.

The CM also directed the health department to ramp up sampling to 50,000 per day, besides vigorously pursuing contact tracing to 30 people per positive patient. Expressing concern over the high CFR rate, the CM said these deaths, many of which are avoidable with timely treatment, pain him. He directed chief secretary Vini Mahajan to undertake public awareness campaign to motivate people to approach hospitals at early stages. The CM said the death audit should be done by all districts and private facilities, which are not participating in the expert group discussions, should be encouraged to do so.Amarinder, who was informed by the health department that the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, was refusing to admit patients from Punjab despite being referred through proper channels, said he would take up the matter with the Prime Minister at Thursday’s video conferencing meeting and would request him to direct the hospital to reserve at least 50 ICU beds for patients referred by the state government. He also asked the chief secretary to address the issue of vaccination hesitancy by undertaking well-designed media campaigns.

              " ' CBI records statement of Dr Jaishri Patil in preliminary probe ordered by Bombay HC  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recorded the statement of complainant Dr Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) guest house in Santacruz (East) in connection with the corruption allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Dr Patil’s statement was recorded after the Bombay high court (HC) directed CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry and submit a report in 15 days based on her petition.Patil reached DRDO guest house around 3pm on Wednesday where the CBI team is stationed. CBI questioned Patil for almost five hours and called her again on Thursday to record further statement. Patil said, “I have submitted the evidence that I have and will visit CBI office again to give further statement.”“I have received several threats on phone as well as on social media from many organisations pressuring me not to speak and give statement to CBI officials against politician” said Patil.On Tuesday evening, CBI registered a preliminary inquiry based on the HC order, and a team comprising six officers reached Mumbai from Delhi the same evening to investigate the matter. A CBI officer said a second CBI team from Delhi comprising around six more officers, including a superintendent of police, also reached Mumbai in the afternoon. Before registering the preliminary enquiry, CBI had consulted their legal team. CBI officers also approached the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday seeking permission to record the statement of former police officer Sachin Vaze who is in NIA custody for allegedly planting a explosives-laden vehicle near the industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25. Vaze had also been named by Singh in his eight-page letter to Maharashtra chief minister wherein he alleged that Deshmukh has asked Vaze and two other officers to collect ₹100 crore from bar and restaurants in the city. The NIA court granted permission to CBI to record Vaze’s statement in connection with the corruption allegations. CBI will also record statements of Singh and the other officers mentioned by Singh during the preliminary enquiry. While directing CBI to conduct a preliminary probe on April 5 in a 52-page judgement, the HC had observed that Malabar Hill police had failed to take action on Patil’s complaint which had pointed to a cognisable offence being committed by Deshmukh. HC noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.” It further observed that as the state police force was under Deshmukh [he resigned after HC’s directions for probe], it would serve the ends of justice if a preliminary probe was conducted by an independent agency such as CBI. “Deshmukh is home minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like CBI,” the bench noted in its judgment. “The allegations made by Shri Param Bir Singh are serious in nature and against the highest functionary of the government of Maharashtra when it comes to the functioning of the police department. Prima facie, the issues are such that the very faith of citizens in the functioning of the police department is at stake. If there is any amount of truth in such allegations, certainly it has a direct effect on the citizens’ confidence in the police machinery in the state. Such allegations, therefore, cannot remain unattended and are required to be looked into in the manner known to law when prima facie they indicate commission of a cognisable offence,” the court observed.

              " ' Getting ambulance for Covid patients a struggle, lament Lucknowites  LUCKNOW Getting an ambulance for a Covid patient requires a VVIP’s recommendation. Ambulances are taking 4 to 12 hours to pick up patients, especially during night hours and in such a situation a number of patients have to be ferried in private ambulances for admission to hospitals, lament citizens. “Getting a referral and ambulance for a Covid patient is even more difficult,” said Ashutosh Kumar, an engineer in the irrigation department, who admitted his brother to a hospital for Covid treatment. “The entire process is so difficult and highly centralised that the attendants of patients have to run from pillar to post to get admission to any hospital. Patients and attendants have no say in the entire process and are at the mercy of officials,” he said. Kumar added, “If you don’t have a source in the CMO office, you will not get a referral letter. Then you will be asked to wait for an ambulance.” “My brother, Paritosh Kumar, was declared Covid positive. After his condition deteriorated on April 2, we called the CMO helpline. I was told that the name of my brother figures on a later number, so his referral would be issued in that order. But I rushed to the CMO office and managed the referral but the ambulance was still out of reach. I was told that the ambulance would take another three hours to take the patient to hospital. So I hired a private ambulance to reach Era hospital,” said Kumar. “If they cannot provide an ambulance promptly, they must give us the numbers of private ambulance operators so that lives could be saved,” added Kumar. An office-bearer of the accredited journalists association had to be shifted from Vivekanand Hospital to the SGPGIMS in a private ambulance on Monday night. The ambulance remained out of reach for the journalist despite the senior state government officials being approached. The patient was admitted to hospital late at night, confirmed a government official. On Monday night, a senior citizen couple in Gomti Nagar who tested positive, waited for an ambulance the whole night (after following the process), but it didn’t arrive. As a result, their referral for a hospital was cancelled and they had to get another referral from the CMO office for admission to a private hospital. The couple had to arrange a private ambulance for themselves on Tuesday morning, said their kin. When called for his version, Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, CMO, said: “I am too busy these days so I will not be able to answer your questions.” However insiders in the CMO office said, “The problem is because of centralisation of everything by authorities. No hospital can admit any patient without a referral from the CMO office. The ambulance is allotted from here and preparation of medical kit, its distribution has to be looked after by the CMO office. Our staff is already overworked.” “Things could be managed well, if the condition of referral from CMO office is removed. Covid patients must be allowed to call 108, 102 to book ambulances directly instead of getting them through the CMO office. The problem is because of centralisation of the process.” Officials of GVK EMRI (responsible for 102, 108 ambulance services) said 18 out of 43 ambulances (102 service) were ferrying Covid patients. The Covid ambulances were making at least 10 to 12 rounds a day. On the other hand, 38 other ambulances (108 service) were reserved for maternal care. On an average, an ambulance takes three to four hours to pick a Covid patient from the house and drop him/her to the hospital, they said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Mumbai: Hritik-Kangana row, copyright violation cases taken away from CIU  Two cases, including the row involving actors Hritik Roshan and Kangana Ranaut, which were previously investigated by now-suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze have been taken away from the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) which has been at the centre of controversies lately. After Vaze’s arrest in the Antilia case and the subsequent revelations about his way of working, joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambhe directed the cyber police station to take over the probe of Roshan’s case on Wednesday.The decision to take away the two cases from CIU was taken after a quick review of the cases handled by Vaze during his nine-month tenure after his reinstatement in June 2020. In the past, high-profile cases registered by the Mumbai Police were being transferred to CIU and Vaze by then police commissioner Param Bir Singh, police sources said.Roshan had lodged a complaint with the cyber police at Bandra-Kurla Complex in 2016 against an unidentified imposter who had allegedly sent emails to several women. The cyber police had then recorded the statements of Ranaut and her sister while probing the case.The reason for the row between the two actors was an email id. Ranaut claimed to have received messages from Roshan from the id, proving they were in a relationship. Roshan, however, said he never had such an email id and added that it was an impostor who had been communicating with Ranaut all along.In December 2020, Roshan’s lawyer made a complaint to Singh about no progress in the case. Following this, Singh had transferred the case to CIU which was then headed by Vaze.Similarly, another case of copyright violation involving the chief executive officer of Maha Movie television channel was also transferred from CIU. Puneet Mehra, son of late filmmaker Prakash Mehra, had filed a complaint of copyright violations with Juhu police last year. He had alleged that their film Zanjeer starring Amitabh Bachchan and Pran was allegedly telecasted on Box Cinema channel on March 12, 2020 without their permission. Mehra holds copyrights of the film.Some of the accused in this case are also named in the TRP manipulation case, hence the case was earlier transferred from Juhu police to CIU. However, the case has been transferred to unit 9 of the Mumbai Police’s crime branch for further probe, a crime branch officer confirmed. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Transport minister Anil Parab debunked Vaze’s allegations saying he was not involved in any extortion case and it was the BJP’s conspiracy to defame the MVA government.“In order to defame the Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray), it was necessary to vilify someone close to the Chief Minister and this is a part of agenda being pursued by the BJP,” Parab told reporters. “I am ready for an inquiry by any agency whether NIA, RAW or anyone. I am even ready for narco test,” he added.In his four-page letter, Vaze alleged that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and sitting transport minister Anil Parab asked him to collect money, but he refused.

In the statements, the two officers have contradicted Singh’s version. A crime branch officer has confirmed the genuineness of the statements.Statements of deputy commissioner of police (establishments) Dr Raju Bhujbal and assistant commissioner of police (social service) Sanjay Patil which were recorded as suo motu measure by joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambhe as head of the crime branch immediately after Singh’s letter to CM mentioned the two officers from his department.Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Vaze to collect extortion money and had also attached a chat with Patil to corroborate the same. However, Patil in his statement to the joint commissioner (crime) stated that he met Deshmukh on March 1 to brief him about some bars and hookah parlours in Thane. On the same day Vaze met Patil and told him that the home minister had asked him if “ ₹3 lakh were being collected from the 1,750 bars and restaurants in Mumbai”, according to Patil’s statement. It was a query and not a demand, Patil stressed.It was Vaze who informed Patil and Bhujbal about his alleged discussion with Deshmukh over collection from 1,750 bars and restaurants. The same was never discussed with Patil and Bhujbal independently by Deshmukh. Patil also stated that he doesn’t know if Vaze met the home minister in person.Singh had also stated that on March 4 Patil and Bhujbal had visited Deshmukh’s official residence Dyaneshwar, but in their statements the two maintained that the three never met.“On March 4, Deshmukh’s secretary Palande was seen asking Bhujbal if such (huge) amount is collected from city’s establishments? To which we (Patil and Bhujbal) responded him in negative,” Patil stated in the statement.Patil further added that he never met the home minister before or after March 1.Singh, in his letter, had cited content of chats with Patil about discussion on Deshmukh demanding money. However, Patil stated that these discussions were pertaining to Vaze informing them about Deshmukh allegedly asking him about daily collection of money from establishments. The chats were not about Deshmukh directly asking Patil for collecting money, the officer said.After recording statements of the two officers, Bharambhe informed the home department about it. A crime branch officer said it was important to record the statements of the two immediately, before they could come under pressure by anyone. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is carrying out the preliminary probe on the orders of the Bombay high court in Singh’s allegations on Deshmukh, would also be independently recording statements of Bhujbal and Patil.

The project was lingering for almost two years over the land. Officials in a meeting at the Air Force Station on Tuesday discussed and mutually agreed on the land for the project and the location of gates. As per a statement issued by the administration, the air force officials have agreed upon allowing land next to Mama-Bhanja Peer on the Jagadhri Road to be used for the project. “It has been agreed that one gate will open on the Jagadhri road and the other inside the station, so that the flight operations from the air force strip could take place safely,” the statement read. Ambala being a sensitive zone due to the presence of large army apparatus and force, the land selection was lingering for quite some time, especially after Rafale jets were stationed here last year. Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said other than district revenue officials, representatives of the Airport Authority of India and Cantonment Board were also part of the meeting. The DC had inspected the land in Garnala, Barnala and other adjoining villages of the station last year. He also held several meetings with the defence officials to resolve the issue. On February 23, Haryana home minister and local MLA Anil Vij had met defence minister Rajnath Singh to discuss the issue. This was his third such meeting. On Wednesday, Vij said there will be a transfer of nearly 15 acres near the station and the construction will be done by the ministry of civil aviation, after necessary approvals. “The airport has already been cleared under Udaan-3.0 scheme by the ministry and I expect that the flight operations for Lucknow and Srinagar will start within two years,” he said.

              " ' Bengal doctors’ forum seeks curbs on political rallies, warns of Covid-19 surge  Rising Covid-19 cases in West Bengal and rampant violation of statutory restrictions at political rallies and roadshows during the ongoing assembly election has prompted a section of doctors in the state to urge the Election Commission of India (EC) to impose restrictions on non-compliant parties. The West Bengal Doctors Forum (WBDF), a popular organization that has been working among patients and health workers since the first Covid-19 outbreak a year ago, wrote to the EC on Wednesday and expressed deep concern. “…the second wave of Covid-19 is sweeping various parts of the country and cases in West Bengal have gone up tenfold in the last one month. The medical fraternity is extremely perturbed,” WBDF wrote to the EC in Delhi. The letter was marked to the state government as well. According to the state health department’s bulletin, 2390 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Wednesday and the number of active cases stood at 14,290. The eight-phase polls in Bengal will end on April 29. On an average, at least two dozen big rallies and roadshows are held on a day by top leaders and campaigners of the contesting parties. The number of smaller meetings and processions is countless. The doctors’ body said there is total disregard for Covid-19 protocols, such as wearing of masks, sanitization, physical distancing etc. during election campaign by almost all political parties. “If stringent measures are not implemented, including barring of non-compliant campaigners and political parties, we are going to face untold miseries,” the letter said. Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy admitted that the situation is serious. “Our party leaders are working overtime all over the state. We are trying our best to maintain health protocols but it is not easy to manage common people. They have to be conscious,” he said. Among the TMC’s top campaigners, chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Bengali movie star and Lok Sabha Member Deepak Adhikari, who is more popular as Dev, draw the maximum crowds. Adhikari is the only campaigner in the state who appeals to people at every rally to wear masks, HT found while studying campaign videos. In all his recent rallies, the young actor spoke at length on the fresh outbreak and told people that their health was more important than anything else. Also, he took off his mask only while speaking from the dais. Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Bengal unit, expressed concern as well. “Since I am contesting the polls I have to go for campaigns. I have come across people who ask me to take off my mask, saying they want to see the candidate. People have become complacent. The BJP has planned a fresh awareness campaign on Covid-19 protocols,” Bhattacharya said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Issues galore in Chandigarh MC’s garbage collection drive  The Chandigarh municipal corporation’s takeover of the door-to-door garbage collection in the city, now in its fourth month, is still facing teething problems, leaving many residents dissatisfied with the new system.In Sectors 1 to 30, the situation has improved over time, but in most other localities, the MC is struggling to achieve seamless collection of waste.Even as the civic body has pressed its own collection vehicles into service this time, three of its MRF (material recovery facilities) plants are yet to become operational. This has resulted in a longer turnaround time of the waste collection vehicles.With the MRF system, the MC would be able to replace around 40 Sehaj Safai Kendras (SSKs). The construction of two MRFs has already started, while the tendering process of the third one was recently finalised. Two of the MRFs will come up in Phases 1 and 2 of the Industrial Area (one near the MC public health store and second near 3BRD), and third one will be set up adjacent to the garbage processing plant in Sector 25. The MRF near 3BRD is expected to be ready by April-end. “The start of MRFs will help reduce the time taken by garbage collection vehicles to cover each sector. Currently, once in every trip, the collector vehicles have to go dump the waste at the Sector 25 processing plant. Since all the vehicles turn up there around same time, the dumping process takes longer,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav.What the residents sayMeanwhile, residents have been complaining about inadequate collection of garbage in the southern sectors, especially from the first and second floors of the residential units. “This is particularly causing much trouble to senior citizens and persons with disabilities. While the mayor and even the MC waste management rules have stipulated that waste would be picked up from people’s doorsteps, but in reality, many areas are being given a miss,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO).Joginder Singh, president, Sector 38-A and B resident welfare association, said, “The MC vehicles came inside the sectors only for a couple of days. Thereafter, the cart-based collectors picked up the waste and carried it to the MC vehicles which were stationed at a central location near the sector.”Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (Crawfed), said, “In Sector 43, the MC vehicles only came for two days and then the cart-based collectors picked up the waste. They segregated the garbage near our houses and then dumped it in the MC vehicles. The situation is similar in the northern sectors like Sector 28.”“In Sector 33, sometimes garbage is picked up on rehris and at times it is done by a garbage van. But the collectors neither wear masks nor take any other safety precautions. Moreover, time to collect garbage is also not fixed,” said Kuljinder Sra, general secretary, Sector 33-B RWA.Meanwhile, under the current system, the MC-deployed vehicles are not collecting waste such as dry leaves. “Garbage is being collected by the same persons who were engaged by us after the MC retained them. But they are now refusing to take dry leaves, horticulture waste and broken pots etc. The civic body has not provided any facility for such waste,” said Kidar Nath Sharma, president, RWA, Sector 46.MC commissioner Yadav said, “I have directed the MC officials to post four attendants on vehicles so that garbage can be collected from the first and second floors also.”Now, most of the informal sector garbage collectors, who were earlier picking up waste through the cart-based system, have also joined the MC, added Yadav.User charges in water bills from JuneThe MC has started collecting garbage user charges in some sectors through point of sale (POS) machines. So far, it has collected ₹18 lakh in user charges through the POS mode.It is planning to add these charges in the water bills from June onward. “All the data regarding the waste collection drive, like total number of kitchens and plot size, is being formulated and once the same is finalised, we will start adding user charges to water bills,” said Yadav.

              " ' HC stays minority status of Chandigarh’s St Kabir School  A division bench of Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed the minority status of St Kabir School, Sector 26.The order has been passed by the bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Rajesh Bhardwaj, confirmed senior standing counsel, UT, Pankaj Jain.It was in March 2020 that a high court bench had dismissed a February 2018 plea filed by the Chandigarh administration challenging the minority status given to the school. In a fresh plea, the administration appealed against the decision.The school was granted minority status in March 2014. Chandigarh has 22 minority schools, and out of the 13 schools that opted for minority status after 2012, only two got a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the UT administration.There has been a spurt in the cases of schools seeking minority status after the apex court directed in 2012 that minority schools were not bound to reserve 25% of the seats under EWS category for entry-level classes under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. The city has a total of 82 private schools.The UT has argued that as per the 2011 Census, Sikhs constitute the second largest majority after Hindus in Chandigarh. With minority status, the school goes out of the purview of the RTE Act for reservation to EWS and the administration is left with no control over fee regulation and no parent can approach it in case of any complaint, the UT had told court.“(St Kabir) School has complete monopoly and can function without any fear of state supervision or accountability,” the UT argued. It added that the school has not got an NOC from the administration, and the commission granted it minority status even after the UT contested the same.In another case of minority status in August 2018, a high court single judge bench had ruled against minority status obtained by Vivek High School, Sector 38, on a plea by the UT administration. Vivek High’s appeal against that judgment is pending before a division bench. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Udayvir Dhillon elected Zirakpur MC president  Udayvir Singh Dhillon, 32, son of Mohali Congress president Deepinder Singh Dhillon, was elected the president of the Zirakpur municipal council for a five-year term on Wednesday.The election was held during the first meeting of the newly elected members of the House, amid a boycott by the Shiromani Akali Dal councillors. No polling took place for the posts of senior vice-president and vice-president. The Congress had won 23 out of the 31 seats in the civic body elections held in February, grabbing the majority from the Shiromani Akali Dal, which had been in power for two decades but managed only eight seats this time. NK Sharma, Akali MLA from Dera Bassi, said the party boycotted the meeting as its demand to conduct elections on all three posts was ignored. Udayvir said the elections to other posts were not held as it was decided by all members. “We will hold the elections for the two posts in the next meeting,” he said. ‘Will remove all encroachments’Udayvir, who is also the Punjab Youth Congress general secretary, won from Ward No. 12. He did his schooling from St John’s High School, Chandigarh, and completed a five-year law course from Punjabi University, Patiala. After getting elected as the council president, he listed removal of encroachments from Zirakpur his top priority. “Before the elections, we gave the slogan of Smart Zirakpur, and we will work towards achieving it,” he said, adding that a committee comprising both councillors and officers will be constituted to identify and remove encroachments.Udayvir said that after more than a decade of unplanned development, the city finally got a master plan in 2009, which has not been implemented yet. “The population is expected to shoot up to 8 lakh by 2030, but now we will change the picture of Zirakpur,” he said.The new council president said even though the MC collected ₹170 crore as development charges from builders, it has failed to elevate the infrastructure, which will be looked into. On unauthorised buildings, he said: “We will first conduct a survey and accordingly take action.”Among other priorities, he listed better waste management, making Zirakpur pollution-free, automated traffic signals at intersections, and construction of community toilets.

              " ' Maharashtra’s stock of vaccine doses to last three more days  Maharashtra is facing a shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses and had to shut down several vaccination centres. It has already requested the Centre to provide adequate stock as it has set a target of inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries a day, said Rajesh Tope, state health minister, on Wednesday.The state is left with 1,400,000 vaccine doses, which will last only three days. It has demanded a stock of four million doses a week from the Centre.Maharashtra tops the chart in vaccinating maximum beneficiaries across the country. Currently, it is covering 450,000 beneficiaries a day and the health minister guaranteed that it will cross the 600,000 mark in the next two-three days, provided it gets adequate stock from the Centre.Tope urged the Centre to prioritise Maharashtra and if required, delay stock supplies to other states as it is the most affected state in the country. The demand to the Centre was made in a video conference meeting chaired by the union minister of health and family welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan. Tope attended the meeting along with the health minister from six other states on Tuesday evening.“Union minister Prakash Javadekar had asked us to double the vaccination numbers and had assured to provide adequate stock. We accepted it as a challenge and increased the daily vaccination to 450,000 from 300,000. However, we have started facing shortage of vaccine stock and have to shut down many centres across the state as there is no stock left there,” the health minister told reporters later. “We have a stock of 1,400,000 vaccines left, which means the state has a stock of three days only and then vaccination would be stopped if fresh stock is not provided. We need a stock of at least 4,000,000 vaccines per week. As health minister of Maharashtra, I can guarantee we will achieve the target of inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries in the next 2-3 days as we have planned mobilization of the resources in that manner,” Tope added.“Vaccination is the most effective measure to control the pandemic at present,” the health minister said, urging the Centre to provide adequate stock and if needed, delay supplies of the stock in other states as the daily cases have breached the 50,000 mark in Maharashtra.He avoided making any allegations of bias against the Centre, but pointed out that there is a difference between what they say and what they do, when it comes to handling the Covid-19 pandemic. “I don’t believe the central government doesn’t want to provide vaccine stock as they have been doing it regularly, but the pace is slow. Dr Harsh Vardhan (union health minister) is a very soft spoken and helpful minister and urged him to give more attention towards Maharashtra,” he commented.Responding to the remarks, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the state government is expected to discuss the issue with the Centre, instead of disclosing them before the media. He stressed that Maharashtra is getting maximum stock of vaccine from the Centre, compared to other states.“The state government should discuss issues with the Centre instead of running away from the situation by speaking about issues in the media. The state government asks the opposition party (Bharatiya Janata Party) not to bring in politics in handling Covid-19 pandemic but its ministers and the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) do the same,” Fadnavis told reporters.He said that the state is getting enough stock for the target group on a regular basis for vaccination. “Sometimes it happens that the stock is left for a few days but then fresh stock arrives from the Centre as supplies are going across the states,” Fadnavis clarified.To increase vaccine production, the state owned Haffkine Institute has already sought permission from the Centre for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech that has developed Covid-19 vaccine — ‘Covaxin’. It has also sought permission for fill and finish operations of Covid vaccine in which Haffkine Institute will only fill vaccines in bottles and make them ready as a product.Haffkine is a public sector undertaking owned by the state government and has developed a number of vaccines that include anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, oral polio vaccine etc. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Maharashtra reports 59,907 new Covid-19 cases  Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 59,907 new Covid-19 infections, its highest single-day spike, and 322 deaths, taking the tally to 3,173,261 and toll to 56,652. The number of active cases also crossed the 500,000 mark with 501,559 active infections. The increasing number of cases in Maharashtra has started burdening its health infrastructure. According to data from the state health department on Wednesday, 80.51% of isolation beds for Covid-19 patients across the state are occupied. It also stated that 32.77% oxygen beds and 60.94% ICU beds are also occupied across the state. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to citizens last week, had indicated that the availability of beds will be a huge concern if cases continue to rise at its current pace. Between April 1 and 7, the state has reported over 360,000 new cases. Dr Pradip Vyas, principal secretary, the state health department, in a meeting chaired by Thackeray on Wednesday, said the number of patients in the state has increased thirty-fold since February 2021. On February 11, 2021, the state had 30,265 active cases. Vyas also said as per an estimation by the Centre, the number of active cases is expected to increase up to 1.2 million by the end of April. If compared to the first wave, there were 310,752 active cases on September 17, 2020, the state said. On Wednesday, Mumbai also reported 10,442 cases and 24 deaths, taking the tally to 483,042 and toll to 11,856. Mumbai also has 83,185 active cases, the second-highest in the state, after Pune, which has 90,048 active cases and which reported 5,637 new cases on Wednesday.State government and medical experts have been expressing concern over the grim statistics, appealing to people to take all precautions. State environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday tweeted, “The 2nd surge that is higher than the 1st has put massive pressure on our doctors, medical staff, frontline workers, Govt and Local Self Govt staff. But more worrisome is the rising cases in this pandemic. I urge all to stay home, stay safe and not endanger self or others.” In a meeting chaired by Thackeray with various trade bodies, Dr. Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, said, “The second wave is like a tsunami, we have to take all the required steps to prevent it. The new strain is also affecting young people and children. The solution lies in breaking the chain of the virus.” A surgeon from Mumbai tweeted, “BMC war room staff is really trying hard to get people the beds they desperately need. But the situation is very grim. I’m continually flooded with calls for beds of patients whose oxygen levels are crashing rapidly.

              " ' Local body elections get Andhra HC nod  Hyderabad The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday gave the green signal to the state election commission to conduct elections to 534 zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) and 7,621 mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) in the state as per schedule on Thursday (April 8). A division bench of the high court on Wednesday dismissed the interim orders given a day before by the single judge bench of the court, stalling the elections to zilla parishads and mandal (block) parishads on the ground that the four-week period for the enforcement of model code of conduct was not being followed. Acting on a review petition filed by State Election Commissioner (SEC) Neelam Sawhney, the division bench gave the green signal to the commission to hold the elections as scheduled on Thursday. The bench, however, ordered that the counting of votes and declaration of results should not be done on April 10. It referred back to the single judge bench to settle the issue. Arguing on behalf of the SEC, senior advocate C V Mohan Reddy said petitioner Varla Ramaiah of the Telugu Desam Party had no locus standi to question the SEC’s decision as he was not a contestant in the elections. He also pointed out that the four-week time for implementation of model code of conduct was not made mandatory by the Supreme Court. It only gave a suggestion, while hearing the case in a particular context. If the code is implemented for four weeks, all the ongoing developmental works would come to a halt, he argued. In all, there are 660 ZPTCs and 9,984 MPTCs in Andhra Pradesh, of which 126 ZPTCs and 2,363 MPTCs were elected unanimously during the beginning of the election process in March 2020. Elections to the remaining ZPTCs and MPTCs will be held on Thursday. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' TN CM’s Edappadi constituency records third highest voter turnout  Chennai: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s constituency of Edappadi registered the third highest voter turnout at 85.60 per cent during the single-phased polling to 234 assembly constituencies on Tuesday, data revealed by the state election commission revealed on Wednesday. The seat belongs to Salem district that witnessed a turnout of 79.2 per cent. While Karur registered the highest voter turnout of 83.92 per cent,, Chennai witnessed the lowest turnout of 59.05 per cent.Palaniswami enjoys strong support in his native village Siluvampalayam and was elected four times from Edappadi constituency. With sleek roads, a flyover and an arts and science college in the past 5 years, the chief minister ensured a huge infrastructure facelift for his village and constituency. Karur, which topped the districts with the highest voter turnout, is witnessing a big political battle between former minister and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader V Senthil Balaji and transport minister and sitting MLA M R Vijayabhaskar.With the lowest turnout, Chennai reaffirmed the idea that it is the urban constituencies that bring down the overall count every election. The Villivakkam assembly segment in the city reported a turnout of 55.52 per cent.A similar situation was also witnessed in Kolathur in the state capital, from where DMK president M K Stalin is seeking re-election, as 60.5 per cent of the voters turned up. The assembly constituencies of both the chief minister (85.60 percent) and the opposition leader (60.5 per cent) polled morevotes than the average registered in their respective districts of Salem (79.2 per cent) and Chennai (59.05 per cent).On Wednesday, chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo said the state had recorded an overall turnout of 72.78 per cent. The figure is slightly lower than what was recorded last year - 74.8 per cent. Experts, however, believe the state witnessed a good turnout as people visited polling stations despite the Covid-19 pandemic and surge in cases. “72% is fairly good and is marginally lower than 2016 which we can attribute to Covid-19,” says political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “The numbers indicate that this will be a neck-to-neck election and it is a waveless election. Popular leaders have also polled numbers similar to previous elections.” The election commission is yet to release the gender-wise data which would provide more insight, he said.Bodinayakanur, from where deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is contesting his former partyman and rival DMK leader Thanga Tamilselvan, saw a turnout of 73.5 per cent. Coimbatore south saw a turnout of 60.7 per cent voters in a three-cornered fight between actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam chief Kamal Haasan, Bharatiya Janata Party’s national women’s wing president Vanathi Srinivasan and Congress’ Mayura Jayakumar. Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni, from where Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi made his electoral debut, registered a turnout of 58.41 per cent.“It seems like there isn’t any anti-incumbency, we may form the government,” an AIADMK leader said, preferring anonymity. “We are sure to win 170 seats. Even in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, we polled 72.4% so we will sweep the election again,” a DMK leader said on condition of anonymity. In 2019, the DMK won 38 out of 39 Lok Sabha seats.

              " ' Tight security for Mukhtar Ansari in UP prison  Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari has been lodged inside barrack number 16 of the Banda district jail after his return from Punjab’s Rupnagar prison, officials said on Wednesday.A team of at least 100 policemen, including two deputy superintendents of police and six sub-inspectors, escorted the Bahujan Samaj Party’s Mau MLA on the over 800-km-long journey from Punjab after taking Ansari’s custody from the Punjab Police on Tuesday. The contingent comprised of GPS-enabled anti-riot vehicle Vajra and heavily armed policemen.The motorcade made only two stoppages in Agra – where drivers were changed – and then briefly in Satti in Kanpur, officials said.The transfer has come after the Supreme Court on March 26 allowed a transfer petition of the UP government seeking transfer of Ansari from Ropar jail in Punjab to Banda in UP. Ansari was initially lodged in a jail in UP as an undertrial when the Punjab Police obtained production warrant against him on a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation and brought him to Punjab in 2019. As the Punjab government refused to shift Ansari to UP citing his medical condition -- he is reportedly suffering from hypertension, diabetes, back pain, skin allergy and depression -- the UP government moved the top court.Only the ambulance ferrying Ansari and one other vehicle were allowed to enter the heavily guarded Banda jail premises on their arrival on Wednesday morning, Banda circle officer Rakesh Singh said.Also Read| Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari brought back to Banda jail from PunjabA statement issued by DG (prisons) headquarters said that Ansari was examined by a team of doctors from Banda medical college before being lodged in the barrack and doctors have found him medically fit. The report of Ansari’s Covid-19 test conducted at Punjab jail is still awaited and a sample was also collected at the Banda jail, the statement said.Additional security measures have been deployed in the jail premises, including round-the-clock video surveillance in the barrack, officials said.Banda jail superintendent PK Tripathi said that other inmates have been denied access to barrack number 16 where the 57-year-old MP has been lodged, and security staff in the barrack have been asked to wear body-cameras.During his earlier stay at the Banda jail, Ansari was lodged in barrack number 15 which was an isolation barrack and it did not have any CCTV cameras, a senior prison officer said.“As many as 30 PAC personnel will be deployed at the jail entrance to ensure tight security outside the gate. Apart from a jailer and two deputy jailers already posted at Banda jail, two deputy jailers have been deployed there to enhance security measures. Besides, the number of head warders and warders has been increased for internal security of the jail,” the official said, adding that a city magistrate rank officer has been made superintendent in-charge of the jail for daily review of security measures.Multiple close circuit television cameras have been installed in the barrack for 24x7 monitoring, the official statement said. Ansari’s activities could be examined from the central command centre set up at prison headquarters in Lucknow for video surveillance jails across UP.On Tuesday, Ansari’s wife, Afshan Ansari, moved the Supreme Court seeking safety for the Mau MLA while he is being shifted to Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh from Rupnagar jail in Punjab, and also during his trial in pending cases in the state.(With agency inputs) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics uttar pradesh ',\n",
              " ' Covid-19: Masks must in pvt cars, even if driving alone, says Delhi high court  It is compulsory for people to wear a mask in a private vehicle even if they are driving alone, the Delhi high court ordered on Wednesday, ruling that a private vehicle on the roads is also covered under the definition of a public place.The high court also came down on four lawyers who petitioned the court last year against fines imposed by the Delhi Police for violating the mask rule, observing that compliance by lawyers encourages common people to wear the masks.A single judge bench of justice Prathiba M Singh held that a moving vehicle, even if occupied at a given point in time by one person, will be a “public place” due to the immediate risk of exposure to other persons in varying circumstances to the outside world.“A mask acts as a suraksha kavach (protective shield) which will prevent the spread of the deadly virus,” the HC said, recalling that several experts, doctors and researchers have emphasised the need to wear face masks right from the early days of the pandemic.The judge said that a person driving alone could get infected while visiting a market, their workplace or a busy street, and go on to infect others who occupy the vehicle later.“If a person is travelling in the car alone, the said status is not a permanent one. It is merely a temporary phase. There could be other occupants in the car prior to the said phase and post the said phase. There could be elderly family members or children who may be picked up from the school or even simply friends or colleagues may travel in the car in the immediate future. Such persons can also be exposed to the virus if the occupant was not wearing the mask,” the court said in its 32-page judgment.Saurabh Sharma, a lawyer who was fined ₹500 for not wearing a mask, had challenged the penalty in his petition filed in September last year. Sharma said the officers who imposed the fine had failed to provide any executive order to establish that it was mandatory to wear masks while travelling alone in a private vehicle.Sharma’s petition echoed a view that had been articulated by many people on and off social media who argued that people should be allowed to take off their masks when driving alone.“Advocates as a class, owing to their legal training have a higher duty to show compliance especially in extenuating circumstances such as the pandemic. Wearing of masks cannot be made an ego issue. Compliance by advocates and lawyers would encourage the general public to show greater inclination to comply,” said the court.The Centre, which had first made it compulsory for people to wear masks in public places in April last year, did not take a stand and left it to state governments to see how they wanted to implement the rule.Residents of the national capital, however, have reservations about the high court ruling.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi’s joint resident welfare association (RWA) forum, said the decision was “not fair”.“We have no option other than to obey the court order. But I think wearing a mask while driving a car with all windows closed should not be made mandatory. When all windows of a car are closed and the person is in the vehicle, then it is a private environment. The court should also take cognisance of political rallies and protests where hardly anyone is seen wearing masks or following social distancing norms,” Vohra said.It is not clear if the HC’s ruling will persuade other states to review their stand on the matter.Political parties seem to have opposing views on the ruling.Mudit Aggrawal, vice-president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, said, “I urge the court to reconsider their decision… This will lead to unnecessary harassment and corruption without any actual benefits in controlling Covid-19 cases.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, welcomed the decision.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We support the court’s ruling. We have even run mask and sanitiser distribution campaigns. We call upon our workers to encourage use of masks by distributing them wherever they are needed.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi high court coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' Centre yet to clear HC judges’ names pending for 20 months  The central government is yet to clear appointment of ten judges in the high courts despite strong adjurations by the Supreme Court in the last three months, with the oldest recommendation in July 2019.On March 25, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde criticised the government for delaying the process of appointment of judges, lamenting that it has been sitting on some recommendations for more than 20 months despite the final nod of the collegium.The bench, which also included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant, had then underlined that 55 names were pending with the government for more than six months, and sought a categorical reply on the timeline to notify appointments of some judges and sending the rest of the names to the collegium for further consideration.The numbers included 10 names after final recommendation by the collegium, and 45 other names proposed in the first stage of the appointment. All 55 had been pending with the government for more than six months.As the Supreme Court is set to hear this matter again on Thursday, people familiar with the development have told HT that the 10 names finally approved by the collegium were yet to be cleared by the government.As read out by justice Kaul from a chart prepared by him during the last hearing, five names for appointments in the Calcutta HC had pending with the government for 20 months, since July 25, 2019, despite the final recommendation of the SC collegium.Similarly, one name for the Jammu and Kashmir high court has been pending for 17 months and four names for the Delhi HC, for seven months. These names have neither been cleared for appointments nor have been sent back to the collegium for a reconsideration or a review based on certain objections that the government may have, people cited above said.The vacancy in the Calcutta HC has gone up to more than half of its total strength. As on April 1, Calcutta HC has a shortage of 40 judges out of its total strength of 72. Similarly, Jammu and Kashmir HC is also short of more than 50% of judges. It has a vacancy of six out of 11 judges whereas Delhi HC has a shortage of 29 out of the total strength of 60 judges.The law ministry did not respond to queries about these pending names till the time of going to press.Meanwhile, the 45 names that were at the first stage of appointment have finally been referred by the government to the collegium for consideration after much delay.As mentioned by justice Kaul in the previous hearing, two names for the Himachal Pradesh HC have been pending for 14 months; 21 names for the Rajasthan HC, for 9 months; 9 names for the Calcutta HC and two names for the Gauhati HC, for 8 months; five names for the Punjab and Haryana HC, for 7 months; and 6 names for the Madhya Pradesh HC, 6 months.Regarding these names, the collegium will now look at the reports sent by the government and will also consult the SC judges which were elevated from the same high courts before making the final recommendations to the government for their appointments as judges.The collegium for the selection of high court judges comprises the CJI and two most senior judges of the apex court.On March 25, the bench had told attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the government, that there had to be a reasonable time frame within which the law ministry must respond after receiving the recommendations from the collegium.This hearing had followed another appeal made by the top court on January 27 when the bench called it a “matter of great concern” that the collegium had not heard from the government for months after sending names and that a proposal will get stuck without knowing the reason.

              " ' Bus services hit as RTC workers begin strike  BengaluruThe Karnataka government on Wednesday said it incurred losses to the tune of around ₹17 crore due to the strike called by employees of the four major state-run bus corporations.Around 1.3 lakh workers of the transport corporations -- Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC) -- started their strike on Wednesday over unfulfilled demands to be paid on par with the sixth pay commission.In Bengaluru, where public buses ferry around 45 lakh passengers a day, the number was down to a few thousand due to the strike.“Normally there are 5,600 buses in Bengaluru. But on Wednesday, there were 145 buses from BMTC, 1,124 private buses and 2,000 maxi cabs were allowed to ferry people as permitted by the transport department,” said an official of BMTC, requesting anonymity.Thousands of people were left stranded in Bengaluru and other parts of the state as buses account for most of the mass transport options in Karnataka and its capital.With buses off the road, auto-rickshaws and cabs reportedly charged over double the average cost of commute in most places.Karnataka chief secretary P Ravi Kumar on Wednesday wrote to the Railways for special train services to mitigate the impact of the bus strike.“This (strike) will cause severe hardship to travelling public. In addition due to upcoming festivals there will be a rush of people going out of Bangalore to their native places,” Kumar wrote in a letter to the general manager of the southwestern railways.The chief secretary requested for special trains on April 9 and 10.“The government has not called us for any talks but continue to give statements in the media that they are ready for talks. The government has asked to call off the strike and then come for talks which is conditional and could prolong the stalemate,” Vijay Bhaskar, a senior office bearer of the transport workers union, said.He said the government had threatened to use Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against them and was also creating an adverse public opinion against their legitimate demands to be paid on par with government employees.

              " ' NSS gen secy’s remarks on Sabarimala sparks fresh political row  Thiruvanthapuram Nair Service Society general secretary G Sukumaran Nair’s remarks that Sabarimala Ayyappa devotees were “still bitter” about the events in 2018 triggered a fresh political row on Wednesday after Kerala law minister A K Balan alleged that the socio-educational body leader had scripted “history” by making political remarks on the issue. Speaking to reporters on the day of polling on Tuesday, Nair said the people of Kerala wanted a change of rule in the state and that there should be a government that stood for values and faith. Launching a fresh attack on the social body leader for his remarks, Balan said on Wednesday: “He will go down in history as the one who sacrificed the organisation’s policy of (maintaining) equidistance (from politics).”The minister on Tuesday had filed a complaint against Nair with the chief electoral officer for “misusing the traditions and names of Gods in an unprecedented manner” on polling day. He added that the general secretary had deliberately tried to polarise voters and portrayed the polls as a battle between believers and non-believers. Speaking on similar lines Communist Party of India (Marxist) party secretary A Vijayaraghavan said: “He (Nair) made a political statement. It was not expected of him.” Senior party leader M A Baby and CPI secretary Kanam Rajendran also decried the statement.The NSS, however, asserted that it was not a sin to point out the agonies and reservations of the believers and that it cannot be intimidated. “I said this when newsmen asked about the temple issue. I only shared the concern of millions of believers. It is not a sin in the country to say I am a believer. Let the government go ahead with its legal move,” Nair said. The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party also rallied behind the social body over the temple row that has been one of the major poll planks during campaigns against the ruling party.“CPI(M) leaders are attacking the NSS blatantly. Every organisation has the right to air its opinion. It has every right to point out the concern of believers. The NSS has always fought for them and it has remained consistent in its position since the temple case began,” former chief minister Oommen Chandy said, adding that the ruling party was turning intolerant as it was expecting a humiliating defeat.Echoing similar sentiments, BJP state president K Surendran said: “Fearing a defeat, the CPI(M) has trained its gun on the NSS.” A body founded by freedom fighter and social reformer Mannath Padmanabhan in 1947, the NSS holds enough influence among upper caste Nairs and roughly constitute 13 to 14 per cent of the Hindu population in the state. The body’s stance on Sabarimala has been constant right from the beginning when the Indian Young Lawyers’ Association filed a public interest litigation in Supreme Court in 2006, challenging the temple’s practice of denying entry to women of child-bearing age, saying it was discriminatory and against gender justice. “We have been fighting for the temple customs for many years. It is wrong to mix it (customs) with gender equality. Different temples have different customs,” Nair said. During the temple agitation in 2018, the body had taken a proactive stand against the Supreme Court order that removed restrictions on women belonging to the 10-50 age group. Review petitions are pending before a nine-member bench of the apex court. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Former Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze blames top Maharashtra ministers for extortion  Suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze alleged on Wednesday that top Maharashtra ministers asked him to extort money from businessmen and establishments, echoing similar charges by former Mumbai commissioner Param Bir Singh that are being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). he Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government denied the allegations. Vaze, who is currently being probed by National Investigation Agency (NIA) for allegedly planting explosives in a car outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house in February and murdering Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran in March, made the allegations in a letter he intended to submit before the special NIA court hearing his case.Transport minister Anil Parab debunked Vaze’s allegations saying he was not involved in any extortion case and it was the BJP’s conspiracy to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “In order to defame the Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray), it was necessary to vilify someone close to the Chief Minister and this is a part of agenda being pursued by the BJP,” said Parab told reporters.“I am ready for inquiry by any agency whether NIA, RAW or anyone. I am even ready for narco test,” he added. He said if he was found guilty, his chief Uddhav Thackeray would hang him to death. He said he would fight this case legally.He said it was clear as state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had claimed that the third minister will soon be in the dock showed he knew of this letter beforehand.Also Read| Sachin Vaze was reinstated at Param Bir Singh’s behest: Mumbai PoliceIn his four-page letter, Vaze alleged that former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and sitting transport minister Anil Parab asked him to collect money, but he refused. He also said that he was approached for money by a man claiming to be close to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.Deshmukh and Pawar belong to the Nationalist Congress Party, while Parab is a member of the Shiv Sena. The Congress is the third partner in the state’s coalition government.On March 25, Vaze requested the court to allow him to say something in connection with the case. The court asked him to put his submission in writing. When he brought the letter on Wednesday, the court refused to accept it.“We submitted the letter to the court, but the court refused to accept it and asked us to follow the correct procedure. The procedure here would be either give a confession statement or give a statement under section 164 of Criminal Procedure code (statement before the magistrate) which we are not willing to,” said Vaze’s lawyer Raunak Naik.NCP chief Sharad Pawar was not available for comment. Former home minister Anil Deshmukh did not respond to calls and text messages.“I am ready for inquiry by any agency whether NIA, RAW or anyone. I am even ready for narco test,” Parab said. He said he would fight this case legally.NCP said that the party was not happy with Vaze’s reinstatement which is a fact but the rest of his claims are completely baseless. Vaze made this attempt to save himself from the wrongdoing done in the past just like Param Bir Singh, it said.“There was displeasure in the NCP as far as Vaze’s reinstatement was concerned but claims about convincing Pawarsaheb is not true. The allegations are baseless and are the same as what Param Bir Singh has already said.

              " ' Jarkiholi shifted from hospital, to stay in home quarantine  BengaluruFormer Karnataka minister and Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Ramesh Jarkiholi was discharged from a private hospital in Gokak in Belagavi district on Wednesday. Jarkiholi, who is accused of sexually exploiting a woman after promising her job, was to appear before the special investigation team (SIT) probing the case, but he failed to do so after testing positive for Covid-19. Following his discharge, he was shifted to his house in Gokak. Citing Covid-19, Jarkiholi refused to talk to reporters waiting outside the hospital. On Tuesday, SIT officers visited the hospital to confirm reports of the BJP leader’s admission. An SIT officer told HT that doctors have advised Jarkiholi to remain in quarantine at home for two weeks. The officer added that the SIT will take a call on questioning him based on expert opinion. Jarkiholi was earlier questioned by the SIT on March 29, when he had sought four days’ time to answer their questions. Jarkiholi’s lawyer Shyam Sundar told reporters on Monday that his client could not appear for questioning because he was unwell. “I have been now officially informed that he has tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted at the Gokak government hospital. Based on inputs from the doctors as to when he will be fit, accordingly, we will inform the investigation officers,” Sundar said. The Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the SIT to submit a report on the investigation so far. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, while issuing notice to the state government and other respondents, said, “We direct the respondent (SIT) to place on record in a sealed cover, report on the investigation so far carried out. Report shall be tendered on the next date-April 17,” read the order. During the hearing of two petitions filed by advocates Geetha Misra and S Umesh, the lawyers had claimed that police officials leaked sensitive investigation details to media personnel with ulterior motives.

              " ' Yatnal continues tirade against CM  BengaluruBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal) on Wednesday said that BS Yediyurappa should resign on his own after April 17, adding that he should thank party workers and high command for getting a two-year bonus as the chief minister.Stating that party legislators were not happy with the CM, Yatnal said they were being forced to stand in front of the media and praise Yediyurappa even though “most of them have not been released any funds for development in their own respective constituencies”.He said the party’s rule bar those over 75 years of age from holding any administrative posts, adding that calls for Yediyurappa to become chief minister in 2023 were not possible.“Does the rule for persons above 75 years not apply? Or have they granted him a special status…,” Yatnal said in Bengaluru on Wednesday.Yatnal has openly sought the removal of 78-year-old Yediyurappa from the top chair. He said Yediyurappa has already got a bonus of two years as chief minister and should resign on his own after April 17. The bypolls to two assembly seats and a Lok Sabha seat will take place on April 17.The BJP has given Yatnal a show cause notice, but there has been no real effort to control the leader or his tirade against his own leader.Yatnal’s stand has given the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) more ammunition to attack Yediyurappa, who faces dissent from within his own government. Several BJP legislators have claimed that they have not been given any grants for developmental works as Yediyurappa continues to help turncoat ministers.Senior BJP leader and rural development and Panchayati Raj minister KS Eshwarappa had recently approached the Karnataka governor to complain that Yediyurappa had bypassed the minister and awarded projects from his department to legislators and others in violation of procedure and rules.Eshwarappa softened his stand against Yediyurappa on Wednesday as he said the national leadership was looking into the issue.“It’s a lie that I filed a complaint against the CM. The question of lodging a complaint does not arise at all. Yediyurappa is our CM. He is my leader,” Eshwarappa said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' B’luru reports rapid growth in Covid cases  Bengaluru From 464 Covid-19 cases on January 1, Bengaluru on Wednesday reported a new high of 4,991 cases, with experts saying the nine-fold increase in around 100 days was an indication of the rapid pace at which the infection was spreading the city. In comparison, Bengaluru took 118 days from its first Covid-19 case on March 8, 2020 to breach the four-figure mark on July 7 last year, when it reported 1,172 of Covid-19 infections, according to government data. The first time Bengaluru breached the four-figure mark this year was on March 19 when the city reported 1,037 cases. It took just nine days since to touch 2,000 cases, 14 days to breach the 3,000 mark and 18 days to cross 4,000 Covid-19 cases. Bengaluru reported almost 5,000 new cases on Wednesday. The rapid pace of infections in the second wave has prompted experts to draw up estimates that the city is likely to record around 6,500 cases per day by April 20. With 4,991 new cases on Wednesday, Bengaluru’s total number of active cases rose to 35,789. The city also accounted for 25 of the total 35 fatalities due to Covid-19 in the state. Karnataka reported 6,976 new cases on Wednesday, taking the active case count to 49,254. The positivity rate in the state is hovering around 6%, according to government data. On the growing number of cases, K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health & family welfare minister on Wednesday said the government will take up more testing where positivity is high. “Nearly 5,000 cases have been reported in Bengaluru alone with a positivity rate of 5.56%. 25 out of 35 deaths in the state have been reported in Bengaluru. Tomorrow I have called a meeting of all senior officers of BBMP, Bengaluru Urban and Rural Districts. The prime minister will also hold a video-conference with all CMs,” he added.The highest case count in a single day in Bengaluru was on October 8 last year when it reported 5,121 infections in 24 hours. But the rapid pace of infections in the second wave, said to have commenced in the beginning of March, is likely to outdo that figure by within another week, experts said. The city has seen only two days without any fatalities due to Covid-19 this year, which highlights the severity of infection. Dr. CN Manjunath, director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research and member of the state’s technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19, said Bengaluru was taking around one fourth of the time taken last year. “Transmissibility in the second wave is faster and definitely higher as well,” Dr Manjunath told HT. According to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) total positive cases in the city came down from 18,551 in December last year to 10,311 in January and 6813 in February this year, until it saw another spike. Total positive cases went up to 31,886 in March and stood at 17,292 in April so far. Experts said the “release phenomena” saw an increased participation in religious fairs, political events, marriages and other public gatherings that later turned into super-spreader events. Dr V Ravi, former head of the neurovirology department at NIMHANS and member of Karnataka’s TAC on Covid-19, said there was a graded lifting of lockdown restrictions after the first wave, which helped control the spread. But people continue to move freely “as though Covid-19 has come and gone”. He said people had adopted caution even after the lifting of the restrictions, but that has now faded with time. “There is tremendous laxity in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Dr Ravi said. “This is being driven by clusters that occur in crowded cities and closed spaces,” he added. According to experts, the chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led state government, which continues to look at people entering the state, has failed to look within for the problem or find an appropriate solution to contain the surge. Meanwhile, the Bengaluru City Police have ordered a ban on use of gyms and swimming pools within the city. They have also imposed Section 144 of CrPC in the city. Bidar, where one of the bypoll constituencies (Basavakalyan) is located, reported 214 new cases on Wednesday, while neighbouring Kalaburagi reported 205 cases. Mysuru, about 125 km from Bengaluru, continued to see a sharp spike as it saw 243 new cases while Tumakuru reported 204 new cases. The mutation of the virus, experts said, showed a possibility of higher transmissibility but nothing to indicate so far conclusively that they were more severe.The Karnataka government hopes that increasing its vaccination cover will help the state contain the growing number of cases. Starting April 11, Covid-19 vaccination can be distributed in all private and government work places that have at least 100 beneficiaries above 45 years of age, the state government said in a statement on Wednesday.“Several large IT firms and industries had earlier requested us to allow vaccination at their premises. Companies can now provide vaccination to their employees at their offices if there are more than 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries. We have crossed 50 lakh inclinations in the state today. Soon we will reach 1 crore,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health & family welfare minister said on Wednesday. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Andhra: 4 die after drinking contaminated water, several hospitalised  Hyderabad Four persons, including two women, died while several others have been hospitalised in the last 24 hours due to severe gastroenteritis caused by contaminated drinking water in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool district, officials said on Wednesday. While three persons from Nandyal died at different hospitals on Tuesday evening, a 50-year-old woman died in Adoni town on Wednesday morning. The three persons from Nandyal, however, were also suffering from other health complications, officials said.“A 35-year-old man was chronic alcoholic and was being treated at a private hospital following symptoms of diarrhoea. Another 56-year-old man, suffering from kidney-related ailment, was referred to a government general hospital at Kurnool where he breathed his last. Another 80-year-old woman, who also showed symptoms of diarrhoea, died due to age-related issues,” Kurnool district medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr Rama Giddaiah said. According to the DMHO, as many as 15 people from Aruna Jyoti Nagar in Adoni town were admitted to the local area hospital on Tuesday evening due to gastroenteritis. “Of them, eight are below 10 years of age and the remaining are adults. A 50-year-old woman died at around 8.20 am on Wednesday while she was being referred to a private nursing home. The condition of all the others is stable,” he said. The district authorities, who inquired into the source of water contamination, found that the victims had consumed water at Maremma Durgamma Devara, a folk festival at Gorakallu in Panyam block. “We have set up a health camp at Gorakallu where 35 cases of diarrhoea have been reported. A team of doctors treated 30 cases and referred the remaining five to Nandyal government hospital,” the official said. District collector G Veerapandian, who called on the affected people in the hospitals, directed authorities to stop the supply of drinking water from Gorakallu where the contamination took place. He also called for supply of clean and safe drinking water to the affected areas and adequate sewage management and sanitation. Following directions from the collector, authorities collected water samples from the affected area and sent them for testing. “The ASHA health workers are conducting a door-to-door survey and are supplying oral rehydration solution sachets to the people in the area,” Giddaiah said. A probe into the incident is underway and officials are likely to initiate action against the guilty once it is completed.Adoni MLA Y Sai Prasad Reddy said municipal authorities must clean water tanks regularly. “I have been closely monitoring the situation and have ensured best possible treatment to the patients,” he said.

              " ' 332 moral policing incidents in two districts since 2010  On March 17, 2020, a group of Bajrang Dal men stopped a bus in Bantwal, near Mangaluru town. The men were in search of two Muslim men and a Hindu woman who were travelling together to attend a wedding in Bengaluru. Videos of the three were shot and shared on social media before the police arrived at the spot. Soon they were handed over to the police, who let them go after informing their families -- just to make sure everyone knew despite the three being adults. This is among the 322 instances of moral policing by vigilantes in reported coastal Karnataka’s Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts since 2010. It was in the former, a 23-year-old Muslim man was beaten up and stabbed by a group of men on Thursday. “While the police keep no record of these instances, especially moral policing, we have been tracking these cases religiously. 322 are only the reported case and there could be many more unknown cases,” said Suresh Bhat Bakrabail of Karnataka Communal Harmony, a Mangaluru-based organisation that focuses on communal violence in the region, who is keeping a record of the instances of moral policing and communal violence in coastal Karnataka. As per Karnataka Communal Harmony’s records, there have been 1,288 instances of communal violence including moral policing, cattle vigilantism, and hate speech in this period. Bhat says in all cases there is a pattern. “Interfaith couples are always attacked by a group of people and never an individual. They are forced to call their parents and their videos are recorded. After these attacks, messages announcing a raid are sent out of social media. All the attacks are well-coordinated.” According to Vidya Dinker, a Mangaluru based activist who has been fighting moral policing, “love jihad”, a term used by some Hindu groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, came to Mangaluru way before it became familiar across the country. “The Hindu-Muslim divide was often used (by political/religious outfits) to convince people there was an attempt to steal girls to convert them. This thought has been institutionalised over a period of time,” she said. The biggest enabler for moral policing according to Dinker is the informant network. Informants, spread across the city provide tip-offs on interfaith couples across the city, and on their movements. “Hindu right-wing groups also have a strong following among auto-rickshaw drivers and employees of private bus operators in the city. They don’t do it for monetary reasons, but they believe in concepts like love jihad,” said Dinker. Another group of informants are employees of security agencies (private security guards) across the city, some of whom are members of right-wing parties. The network is further strengthened by local merchants and anyone who is a right-wing sympathiser, Dinker added. “Mobile numbers of local right-wing leaders are easily available in the city and right-wing organisations deploy their members at a handful of popular hang-outs in the city,” she said. An activist in the city, who didn’t want to be named said that a security agency, Eshwari Manpower Solutions, which provides security to prominent commercial establishments in the city including malls, is run by a leader of the Bajarang Dal, Sharan Pumpwell. “The security business and fear go hand in hand. Once Pumpwell’s firm is in charge of the establishment, there will not be an attack on the mall, like the pub attack that happened years ago. So, the fear created using these attacks are used to get business as well,” alleged the activist. Pumpwell said that his business and politics are separate from each other. “I get business because of the business and rate I provide,” he said. Talking about the instances of moral policing involving his group’s members, Pumpwell said: “We are only protecting our sisters from those who are trying to convert them in the name of love. You must have heard about how girls are sent to ISIS. We don’t want it to happen here. We don’t take the law into our hands. We simply hand them over (to the police); it is the police’s job to investigate.” There are issues with that as well, said activists. Dinker claims there have been instances of the police telling couples from different communities not to be seen in public together. “The sense of flawed morality and communalism remains within the police department itself. This is one of the reasons why many don’t file a police complaint. But the recent case (attack on Thursday) the girl stood her ground to get the complaint,” she said. Shashi Kumar, Mangaluru police commissioner said that police take all cases of moral policing seriously. “In all cases, including the one reported recently, we have registered cases and arrested the culprits.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Italy gave families of two fishermen killed by marines ₹10 crore in damages  The central government on Wednesday informed the Supreme Court that the families of two Indian fishermen killed by Italian marines off the coast of Kerala in 2012 have been “adequately” compensated as it sought expeditious closure of proceedings before the top court and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the matter on April 9.According to the Centre’s compliance affidavit dated January 5, which HT has seen and reviewed, the Italian government offered to pay a total of ₹10 crore in damages. The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat had also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore.As per the affidavit, the Kerala government also accepted this proposal from the Italian government and the consent letters from the legal heirs of the deceased and the boat owner were sent to the foreign secretary in the ministry of external affairs. On Wednesday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde that the victims’ families have been paid the compensation, as ruled by an international tribunal in May 2020.“The victims’ families are also here, as asked by the bench on the last date of hearing. This is a short matter and only requires to be disposed of on the next date,” the law officer told the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Mehta requested the bench to take up the matter for hearing on Friday saying “there is some urgency since it is between the Indian and Italian government” and the bench agreed.CJI Bobde retires on April 23. The government has sought an urgent hearing so that the matter could be disposed of by the same bench before the CJI demits office.During the last hearing in August 2020, this bench had said that it will close the proceedings only after the families of the victims are heard and given “adequate” compensation, after it noted that the victims’ families were not parties to the case before the Supreme Court.The case pending before the Supreme Court is an appeal filed by the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, against a May 2012 judgment of the Kerala high court, which held that Kerala had jurisdiction to try them. The high court ruled that the marines enjoyed no state immunity since their act of shooting at the fishermen was in defence of neither the vessel nor the state.The marines and the Italian government moved an appeal before the top court, which shifted the trial to a special court Delhi in 2013 where it went on till the Supreme Court stayed it in 2015 after taking note of proceedings pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at the Hague, Netherlands. In the meantime, the marines were allowed to go back home on a personal undertaking by the Italian ambassador that they would come back as and when required.The arbitral proceedings before the PCA were instituted under the United Nations Convention on Law of Seas (UNCLOS) on June 26, 2015 after Italy served a notice on India under the UNCLOS.The UNCLOS is an international agreement that defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with regard to their conduct and use of world seas and oceans and management of natural marine resources.In May 2020, the international tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them.At the same time, the tribunal also held that Italy had violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.On July 3, 2020 the Centre moved the top court, saying it had accepted the PCA’s ruling and wanted the proceedings to be closed.“The Republic of India has taken a decision to accept and abide by the award passed by the (arbitral) tribunal which would have the bearing on the continuance of present proceedings before the Supreme Court. The applicant (central government) is, therefore, placing the award on record with a prayer that the proceedings with regard to the incident dated February 15, 2012 be disposed of in conformity with the Award passed by the tribunal”, its application before the Supreme Court said.

              " ' Apex court to hear Deshmukh’s plea against CBI probe into graft charges today  The Supreme Court will on Thursday take up petitions by the Maharashtra government and its former home minister Anil Deshmukh against the Bombay high court order on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of extortion against Deshmukh, who resigned soon after that verdict.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta will examine the petitions that have challenged the HC order citing “federal structure” and “misuse of central agencies” such as CBI.Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi are expected to appear for Deshmukh and the state government respectively. Former attorney general and senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi will represent former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, whose allegations prompted the high court to order the CBI probe on Monday, although the order itself was in response to a related public interest litigation filed by a lawyer.Singh alleged that Deshmukh asked policemen, including suspended officer Sachin Vaze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants, and other establishments. The allegations followed drama over police investigations into the discovery of an explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the alleged murder of businessman, Mansukh Hiran, linked to the vehicle. Vaze was arrested and has been named the main accused in both cases; Singh was transferred out for his handling of the case; soon after, Singh wrote to the chief minister airing his allegations and then approached the court.Also Read| Former Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze blames top Maharashtra ministers for extortionOn Tuesday night, CBI issued a statement saying the agency has registered a PE (preliminary enquiry) to investigate allegations against Deshmukh, as ordered by the Bombay high court.In his petition, Deshmukh contended that the CBI probe against him “impacts the federal structure”, and could lead to a “biased investigation”, apart from destabilising the state government.Nationalist Congress Party leader Deshmukh emphasised that the high court, relying on certain unsubstantiated allegations by Singh, entrusted the probe to an agency “which the state government has the least confidence in”. He also pointed out that the high court did not give him an opportunity to be heard before it passed the impugned order.Deshmukh resigned on Monday, hours after the order by the high court asking CBI to conclude a preliminary inquiry within 15 days, making him the most high-profile casualty so far in the twists and turns over the discovery of the explosives and the death of Hiran.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government, in its separate petition, has complained that the CBI investigation was ordered without any fact or formal pleadings and that the central agency was brought in without letting the state agencies first conduct their investigation.It also argued out that the state, for valid reasons, has already withdrawn its general consent to CBI to carry out investigations in Maharashtra, and that the high court should have remained mindful of this aspect before ordering the probe.The state further highlighted that Maharashtra has already ordered a judicial probe into the allegations on March 30 by retired Bombay HC judge KU Chandiwal and that the high court could not have straightaway passed the order on a CBI probe without examining the formal pleadings and submissions of the state.

              " ' Slugfest heats up ahead of last five Bengal poll phases  Political parties stepped up offensive against rivals while campaigning for the fourth phase of Bengal assembly elections on Wednesday, with Union home minister Amit Shah hitting out at the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and expressing confidence over Bharatiya Janata Party’s victory in the state, while chief minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the BJP for allegedly resorting to unfair poll practices.Polling has been completed in 91 of the 294 assembly seats in the state, which will see five more phases of elections. The fourth phase of voting will see 44 constituencies in north and south Bengal districts go to the polls on April 10.Shah on Wednesday addressed back-to-back rallies and roadshows in Hooghly, Howrah and Kolkata for a dozen BJP candidates, including MP Babul Supriyo (who is contesting from Tollygunge in south Kolkata) and former TMC minister Rajib Banerjee (who is contesting from Domjur in Howrah from where he was previously elected twice).At his road show in Howrah, Shah touted his party’s development push and said his party will win between 63-68 of the 91 assembly seats where polls have been held in the first three phases of voting.“Do you want a government that thrives on kickbacks and serves only the nephew? ” Shah asked a crowd at Sankrail in Howrah, in an apparent reference to TMC leader and chief minister’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee.Earlier in the day, Shah also had lunch at the residence of rickshaw driver Sishir Sana in Howrah.Meanwhile, CM Banerjee triggered a controversy on Wednesday for her remarks against paramilitary personnel on poll duty.Banerjee, addressing a rally at Cooch Behar district in north Bengal, asked supporters to “keep an eye” on Central Reserve Police Force personnel near polling booths. “Keep an eye on CRPF personnel. Gherao them because they do not let people cast their votes. While one team will engage them in conversations, the other team will cast votes. This is how everyone can exercise their franchise,” she said.“The BJP’s CRPF is beating women, harassing and killing people. They are obstructing voters from entering polling booths and to cast their votes. Union home minister Amit Shah has instructed them to do so,” she said, adding: “I respect the CRPF. But, I do not have respect for those among them who are working at the behest of the BJP. The CRPF should not obstruct the public from casting their votes.”Also Read| EC notice to Mamata over ‘split Muslim vote’ remarkState BJP leader Shishir Bajoria lodged a complaint with chief electoral officer (CEO) Aariz Aftab in Kolkata and demanded that Banerjee be stopped from campaigning and her party derecognised. The statement against security forces was “seditious and anti-national”, the BJP leader wrote in the letter to the CEO.An official at the CEO’s office said the district magistrate of Cooch Behar has been asked to submit a report.Banerjee, whose party has accused the Election Commission of being “biased” towards the BJP, was also asked by the Election Commission to explain her remark within 48 hours on a remark asking the Muslim community not to vote for the BJP.The BJP also alleged that after Banerjee’s speech in Cooch Behar on Wednesday, TMC workers in the district’s Sitalkuchi attacked the vehicle in which state president Dilip Ghosh was travelling in, and that BJP candidate Dipak Kumar Roy had faced a similar incident in Sitai constituency. The TMC’s district president Partha Pratim Roy dismissed the allegation“We told the CEO that by making such statements Banerjee may trigger untoward incidents,” Bajoria added.Trinamool Congress’s state spokesperson Kunal Ghosh responded, saying: “There is terrible infighting in the BJP in that region. It is quite possible that the alleged vandalism was a fallout of that. TMC flags can be found everywhere. Anybody can pick them up. The TMC is not involved in this.”At a rally in Cooch Behar, the chief minister also warned people not to allow BJP to win votes through cash. “Do not take money from the BJP for casting votes. It is a sin,” she said, referring to a ₹1,000 coupon purportedly distributed by the BJP to residents of Raidighi in South 24 Parganas in exchange for votes ahead of the third phase of polling.“This is absolutely baseless. Our party never distributes such coupons. The EC will find out the truth if it conducts a probe,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.On Wednesday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister and BJP leader Yogi Adityanath too addressed rallies in the Darjeeling hill region, where polls will be held in the fifth phase on April 17.Polling in all eight phases will be held on April 29 and counting on votes on April 29.

              " ' Sachin Vaze was reinstated at Param Bir Singh’s behest: Mumbai Police  Mumbai Suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze was directly reporting to then police commissioner Param Bir Singh before his (the former’s) arrest on March 13, said Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale in an official report on Wednesday. Assistant police inspectors do not usually report directly to the chiefs.The report, submitted to the Maharashtra home department, added that Vaze was given executive posting in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) at the insistence of Singh despite resistance from then joint commissioner (crime), Santosh Rastogi. Vaze was suspended from the force in March 2004 for his involvement in a custodial killing case; he was reinstated in the force in June 2005 by a committee headed by Singh.Singh did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with an explosives-laden car found outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia on February 25, and the subsequent death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran (in whose possession the car was) on March 5. The agency on Wednesday summoned Singh for interrogation in connection with the two cases.According to officials from the home department, the report was asked for immediately after Vaze’s arrest.In his report, Nagrale , who replaced Singh on March 17 , said all critical decision related to arrests, raids, remand applications, anticipatory bails were taken under Vaze’s directions. The report also said Vaze neither reported to his immediate bosses in the crime branch nor let his subordinates do so.“Vaze used to accompany Param Bir Singh during the briefing to the minister, home, on critical cases including TRP scam, Antilia explosive scare, Dilip Chhabria’s arrest. Vaze never obeyed the hierarchy of ranks to report over the cases under investigation,” the report said, referring to some high profile cases the Mumbai Police has investigated over the past few months -- allegations of manipulations of television ratings and celebrity car designer Chhabria’s involvement in a car financing fraud.Singh was transferred by the state government after the NIA and the state anti terrorism squad began investigation in the Antilia explosives and Mansukh Hiran case.The two connected cases have roiled the state government and the Mumbai Police. On February 25, a SUV with explosives was found outside Antilla with a threat letter addressed to the billionaire businessman and his wife. The vehicle has been reported stolen by Hiran, an auto parts dealer, on February 17. Vaze was initially put in charge of the case but removed when questions rose about his relationship with Hiran. It later emerged that the two did know ach other and Vaze had even borrowed the same Scorpio and used it for months before returning it in early February. Hiran’s body was recovered from a creek in Mumbai on March 5. NIA, which is investigating the two cases, and the state ATS, which was investigating the Hiran death before it was taken over by the federal agency, have both identified Vaze as the main accused in the case.Singh was transferred out on March 17, and soon after wrote a letter to the chief minister accusing the state home minister Anil Deshmukh of directly briefing Vaze to extort up to ₹100 crore a month from restaurants and bars. He approached the Supreme Court with a plea built around his letter, alleging that his transfer was motivated, and seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the allegations he raised.On April 5, the Mumbai High court said CBI should conduct a preliminary enquiry in the case. Shortly after, Deshmukh resigned.Nagrale’s letter also claims that Vaze’s appointment in CIU in June 2020 was strongly opposed by the then joint commisioner (crime) Santosh Rastogi.“The decision about the reinstatement of Vaze was taken in a suspension review committee meeting on June 5, 2020, chaired by Singh, joint police commissioner (administration) and other two senior officers. Vaze was reinstated on June 9 and was given posting in CIU, after initial appointnement in Armed unit,” the report stated.The report also said that though the CIU was earlier headed by an officer of the rank of inspector, Vaze was appointed on Singh’s direction.Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “We have been demanding the interrogation of Singh by NIA because of his close proximity with arrested API Vaze. It has been now established that Singh is as responsible as Vaze in these two cases. The DVR which has been misplaced from the Mumbai Commisioner office will certainly throw more light on this entire link, if retrieved.”The Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena are partners in the state’s MVA government.

              " ' Coronavirus: In Maharashtra, mutation raises infectivity concerns  One of the two mutations feared to have spread rapidly in Maharashtra may have the ability to make the Sars-Cov-2 more adept at infecting humans, improve its ability to multiply within a host and possibly escape a more complex part of the human immune response, a new study awaiting peer review suggests.The findings, if established, could explain the surge of cases in the western state, not just in capital Mumbai , but in other cities such as Pune and Nagpur as well.The findings relate to the mutation known as L452R, which is one of the two “double mutations” the Indian government said was detected in large numbers in parts of Maharashtra. The state is by far the worst-hit region in India, with an exponential rise in infections that has forced authorities to bring back lockdown-like curbs.Till now, little has been known about this mutation in particular, although it is part of the variant that has triggered a similarly serious wave of infections in California.Now, a team led by researchers from Japan has found the L452R mutation can “potentially increase viral infectivity” and escape from what is known as HLA-A24-restricted immunity, which refers to action by adaptive immunity in the human body.Also Read| Covid-19 in Mumbai: In second wave, kids more symptomatic“Frankly speaking, these two findings mean the L452R can be more dangerous than prototype (the predominant Sars-Cov-2 variant), particularly for people harbouring HLA-A24 type,” said Kei Sato, one of the authors and professor, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, in an e-mail exchange.HLA-A24 refers to a particular gene that some people carry, and the authors note that it is most commonly found in populations in East and Southeast Asian countries. It tends to influence how cellular immunity works in some people, which in this case appears to be hindered in the context of a Sars-Cov-2 infection.The study, based on laboratory experiments, showed L452R conferred multiple properties: it appeared to make the S protein (which the virus uses to latch on to human cells) more stable, it enhanced affinity to ACE2 (the receptor or doorway the virus uses to enter cells), and it seemed to enhance how the virus multiplied.Immune response to a pathogen such as Sars-Cov-2 typically has multiple levels, including antibodies that bind to the virus and stop it from infecting people and killer T cells that destroy infected cells.The HLA-restricted immunity influences the mechanism of killer T cells, which may be crucial since research has separately established a link between the timing and nature of immune response with how severe the disease becomes for someone: often, those with serious or fatal Covid-19 have a delayed immune response.“Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that the HLA-restricted CTLs (cytotoxic T cells, or killer T cells) play crucial roles in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections and Covid-19 disorders,” the authors note in their study.Also Read| Maharashtra facing shortage of vaccine stock, many centres shut: Rajesh TopeThis is not the first time a particular Sars-Cov-2 mutation is shown to be evading some component of the cellular immunity, but it is the first time a widely spreading mutation has been shown to demonstrate that characteristic.Sato said the team will next evaluate how this mutation could influence immunity conferred by vaccines.To be sure, how the variant in Maharashtra behaves will require tests and epidemiological analysis involving that variant itself. A variant also includes multiple mutation, and these can combine to add or remove particular characteristics to the Sars-Cov-2. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus maharashtra ',\n",
              " ' Students lost a year due to Covid-19, but learnt many lessons, says PM Modi  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday interacted with 1.3 million students, teachers and parents from over 90 countries in the fourth edition of his Pariksha pe Charcha, saying that students “lost a year of their lives” due to the Covid-19 pandemic.In an hour-long virtual interaction, the PM also said that universities should study the impact of the pandemic on families.“As far as Covid is concerned, I believe that you have faced trials for a mistake that you did not make. This is a lesson that many times in life, events occur that are beyond your control. Students have lost a year of their lives and it will not be easy to make up for that,” the PM said in his annual interaction with students.While he highlighted the importance of the classroom set up, Modi also said that living indoors with families has made people realize “the importance of people in our lives”.“During the Covid-19 times if we have lost much, we have also gained. The biggest learning is that we have come to realise the importance of people in our live. We have learnt we can’t take anything for granted. The pandemic has also increased the bonding between families. I would want our universities to study the impact of Covid-19 on families,” he said.The Prime Minister also stressed on the need for positive motivation for students ahead of exams and creating a conducive environment for holistic growth.“The first step to motivating children is training. There are many ways to do this, through books, stories and experiences. If you want your child to wake up early, don’t force them to do it. Instead, introduce them to books and discuss with them the benefits doing the same,” the PM said.He said that by creating an environment of fear, children will work in a restricted ambit. “Negative motivation does not work. The fear will eventually fade, and child will return to old habits. The mantra for everyone should be positive motivation, which has a long-lasting impact,” Modi said.The PM even offered a “memory ki jadibooti (herbs)” and urged the students to “involve, associate and internalize.“When you listen to the national anthem, visualise yourself traveling through the entire country. If you get involved in the information, if you understand it, then you will not forget,” he said.Addressing the fear of exams, the PM said, “Exams aren’t a question of life and death. Parents tend to pressurise children, which causes them to fear exams. We should avoid that. Their confidence will increase only if we eliminate external pressure.”Abhishek Singh, CEO of Mygov, citizen engagement platform, said that the participation for the fourth edition increased exponentially. “For the first time, there has been international participation. There were participants from nearly 94 countries. Over 13 lakh people registered for the session.”In February, it was announced that Modi’s annual interaction with students would be held online this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The first edition of the PM’s interaction with school and college students “Pariksha Pe Charcha 1.0” was held at the Talkatora Stadium on February 16, 2018.

              " ' Covid-19 in Mumbai: In second wave, kids more symptomatic  Doctors treating Covid-19 patients have marked a distinct trend during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic -- the virus now appears to be impacting children more severely. Relatively unaffected during the first wave, children and adolescents are now showing more obvious symptoms such as prolonged fever and gastroenteritis, the doctors said.“During the first wave, most children remained asymptomatic, and a large number of them went untested because of that,” said paediatrician Dr. Bakul Parekh. “We tested children only when someone in the family had a history of Covid-19. A small number of children did have mild symptoms, which lasted only for a day or two.”Over the last fortnight, Parekh, who runs a children’s hospital in Ghatkopar, has admitted six children between 1 and 7 years old to the hospital -- three with severe gastrointestinal infections and fever, and others with breathlessness and fever. “Those with gastrointestinal infections had to be put on intravenous fluids. The patients who were breathless required steroids and oxygen support,” said Parekh.During the first wave, Parekh does not recall referring even a single child who needed hospitalisation.He links new mutations with the increased impact on children. “The available medical literature shows that the ‘double mutation’ found in Maharashtra (now called B1.617) can be one of the reasons behind it,” he said.Also Read| Over 10,000 new Covid cases in Mumbai again; Maharashtra tally up by nearly 60KIn Mumbai, schools have remained closed since March 2020, but children are seen playing outdoors within housing society premises, as well as stepping out with elders. This is increasing the risk of carrying the infection as well as getting infected, experts said. “Children are definitely more symptomatic now than what we saw in the first wave,” said Dr. Tanu Singhal, a paediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. “The severity of their illness has gone up,” she said. According to Singhal, most of her patients are from the upper-middle class, who perhaps did not go out at all last year.Mumbai has recorded 472,332 cases as of April 7, of which 77,495 are currently active, according to the BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard. Of the total cases, 27,233 infections were seen among children and adolescents-- 7,675 below nine years of age and 19,558 between 10 and 19 years of age. In Maharashtra, the total number of infections among children and adolescents is 299,185. Of these 95,272 are below 10, and 203,913 in the 11-20 age-group, according to a report issued by Maharashtra’s public health department on April 7.As the number of cases rise, infection among children has also increased. However, the percentage of children and adolescents affected in the first wave and the second wave hover around 10% of total cases. What is striking is the change in symptoms, underline experts.Also Read| Maharashtra facing shortage of vaccine stock, many centres shut: Rajesh Tope“Children are coming in with abdominal pain and severe diarrhea, which we didn’t see in the first wave,” said Dr. Soonu Udani, paediatrician and critical care specialist at SRCC Children’s Hospital.“Some of them require intravenous fluids. In the first wave, most children were simply kept under observation, and in case of mild symptoms, they would respond to basic medication like paracetamol,” she said. Last year, of the paediatric patients who came to SRCC Hospital for other procedures and treatments, about 5% tested positive for Covid-19. “This time, we have about 30% to 40% of the children testing positive,” said Udani.Doctors have observed some distinct changes in the presentations of adults, too. “Conjunctivitis is definitely more common now. Many adults are coming with post-vaccination Covid-19. The unusual thing is that they have developed antibodies, “ said Dr Sujeet K Rajan, a respiratory medicine specialist from Bombay Hospital.Post-vaccination Covid-19 is being seen across the city, including among the health care workers who were first to be vaccinated. But experts say that their illness is truncated and extremely mild. “It is therefore important for people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Even if they do get infected, these mild infections can be handled easily and these cases don’t put pressure on the health care system. Another important thing is not to let your guard down post-vaccination,” ” said Dr. Jalil Parkar, who consults at Lilavati Hospital. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics mumbai coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' IIT-Roorkee emerges as the latest hot spot after 80 students test +ve for Covid  In the latest case of an institute of higher education turning into a Covid-19 hotspot, the Haridwar district administration on Wednesday declared five hostels at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, as containment zones after 80 students tested positive for the viral disease.The IIT Roorkee administration has directed students to isolate themselves in their rooms and has turned one of its hostels into a Covid care centre, the institute’s media cell in-charge Sonika Srivastava said.While 60 tested positive till Tuesday, 20 more tested positive in the RT-PCR tests conducted by Haridwar district health department in the institute on Wednesday.“After the 80 students tested positive in the institute, five hostels named Cautley, Kasturba, Sarojini, Govind Bhavan and Vigyan Kunj have been sealed and declared containment zones by the Haridwar district health department. The institute has about 3000 students of which about 1200 are in these five hostels,” added Srivastava.“The institute has turned its Ganga Bhavan hostel as the Covid care centre under the supervision of district health department where the infected students are being treated. Apart from this, one guest house and another establishment have been turned into quarantine centres for the first contacts of the infected students,” she said.Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha said on Wednesday, “We had taken RT-PCR samples of about 2000 students and staffers from the institute after detection of infections. Till Tuesday, 60 tested positive and on Wednesday 20 more came out positive. However, many of them are asymptomatic and are undergoing treatment in the Covid care centre there under our supervision,” he said, adding that the health department is monitoring the situation.”Meanwhile, students attending online classes from homes have been asked not to return to the campus, Srivastava said.On Wednesday, the country recorded 126,260 new cases, taking the tally to 12,926,024.On Tuesday, as many as 40 doctors tested positive for Covid-19 at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow, the university’s spokesperson Sandeep Tiwari said. Those infected have been admitted in the isolation ward of the medical college hospital, he added.The new cases have been reported days after the Ahmedabad campus of the Indian Institute of Management and the IIT Jodhpur campus were sealed after recording several cases.On Monday, the Jodhpur campus of IIT reported 70 cases, including 54 students, prompting district health authorities to seal the premises after declaring it a containment zone.Of the 54 students, 51 are under treatment at a isolation facility of a hospital on the campus, said Amardeep Sharma, the joint registrar of IIT-Jodhpur.Sharma said that the other infected people included housekeeping and security staff. “IIT-Jodhpur allowed post-graduate and PhD students to return to the campus for their thesis and project work. Some UG and first year PG students returned to the campus and they are being sent directly to the designated isolation wards. All students in isolation wards are getting tested for Covid-19 on the fifth day of their arrival. Only after obtaining a negative RT-PCR report, they are allotted rooms in regular hostels,” Sharma said.Late last month, IIM-Ahmedabad reported 191 Covid-19 cases, of which at least 86 were students residing in the hostels on campus. A statement from the institute released on Monday said that the Covid-19 spread was under control and all protocols were being followed.Meanwhile, the management at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, has reiterated the need for following Covid-19 norms on the campus.The director of the institute, Prof Subhasis Chaudhuri said that at least 19 people, including staff and students, have tested positive for Covid-19 over the last two weeks and are currently undergoing treatment at the campus hospital.While the institute has restricted residents on the campus from venturing out, it has also intensified contact tracing. “We conduct reverse as well as forward contact tracing to try to identify what restrictions to place to avoid the spread. Based on this, we decided to maintain 10 day quarantine for students returning [from home]. We have not allowed any indoor eateries [other than hostel messes],” said Prof S Sudarshan, the deputy director of academic and infrastructural affairs at IIT-B.

              " ' Centre allows vaccination at workplaces  The Union health ministry has allowed vaccination drives at workplaces in a move, aimed at speeding up the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations even as the second wave of the viral pandemic rages through the country. The ministry has written to the states asking them that this be allowed from Sunday, April 11, provided there is an availability of at least 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries.“…in order to increase the access of vaccines to these populations, Covid-19 vaccination sessions may be organized at work places (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these work places with an existing Covid vaccination centre (CVC). .. initiate due consultations with public and private sector employers and management to prepare for launch of work place vaccination. Such work place vaccination centres may be launched across states and UTs from April 11, 2021,” wrote Union health sectary, Rajesh Bhushan, to all state chief secretaries and principal secretary (health).While the move will help to some extent, especially in the cities, it is unlikely to address the two key issues slowing the vaccine drive -- supplies and a tight eligibility criteria. To be sure, much of India’s workforce (at least 80% according to the International Labour Organization) is in the informal sector.The vaccinations at the workplace will be a paid service, and the price is capped at ₹250 per dose.Also Read| Covid-19: Urban hot spots drive surge, in greater need of jab scale-upThe idea behind the move is to rapidly cover eligible beneficiaries . It will also ensure that people do not need to travel to get vaccinated, therefore, avoiding the risk of contracting the viral infection.“A substantial proportion of population aged 45 years and above are in the organised sector of the economy, and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private)…” Bhushan wrote in the letter.The threshold of 100 minimum eligible beneficiaries has been set to have optimal vaccine utilisation, and to avoid wastage as far as possible. It would, however, restrict the provision to companies with very large offices at a single location.The health ministry’s guidelines said it will be the responsibility of the district task force, chaired by district magistrate, and urban task force, chaired by municipal commissioner, to identify government and private workplaces after due deliberation with relevant employers and head of offices.Workplaces have been asked to designate an employee as a nodal officer to oversee and facilitate all aspects of the vaccination process.Experts welcomed the move.“This is a welcome step. Having more sites and involving more health workers is a prerequisite for enhancing coverage, including expanding to other age groups. Covering persons in workplaces can speed up the pace of vaccination. This approval is aligned with the requests made by some state governments. The next step should be to have outreach sessions, wherein front-line health workers can take vaccines to people,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, founder and director, Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, said, “Covering the 45-plus population that is at highest risk should be the priority at this time, but I am not sure that most of them are working in the organised sector.”Also Read| As India records 126,260 new Covid-19 cases, curbs in more statesThe ministry has warned against outsiders, non-employees or family members of employees, taking the jab during these sessions.According to the guidelines, beneficiaries will still need to register on the Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination. The facility of on-the spot registration will also be available to employees.To manage adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), all workplace vaccination centres will be attached to a hospital and have a medical officer as supervisor, an anaphylaxis kit, and a basic life support ambulance for shifting beneficiaries to the hospital, if required.

              " ' As India records 126,260 new Covid-19 cases, curbs in more states  More regions on Wednesday were forced to reintroduce lockdown-like curbs on social movement due to rising cases of the coronavirus disease with second wave of infections continuing on a relentless march as India, for the second day in a row, set a new record for daily surge in infections with 126,260 new infections.On Tuesday, a complete lockdown was announced in Chhattisgarh’s capital Raipur from April 9 till April 19, while the Punjab government extended its state-wide night curfew till April 30, even as Bengaluru ordered a ban on use of swimming pools and gyms in the city.These are the latest in a string of regions across the country that have again started enforcing a wide range of curbs ranging from night curfews to limits on public assembly as they struggled to reel under the second wave of Covid-19 cases.Pushed by Wednesday’s new infections, the seven-day average of daily cases touched 100,761 new cases a day on average, which means that India’s second wave has now surpassed the peak of the first wave, which peaked at 93,617 new cases for the week ending September 16, 2020. The seven-day average of daily cases is taken as a representation for the Covid-19 case curve of a region.Also Read| Covid-19: Urban hot spots drive surge, in greater need of jab scale-upOn Tuesday, Delhi had clamped a night curfew on movement and assembly of people between 10pm and 5am every day until April 30, joining the growing list of major cities such as Mumbai, Chandigarh that have been forced to reintroduce curbs on social movement. In Maharashtra, which is contributing roughly half of all cases in India, authorities have imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses to shut down, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.Night curfews are among the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions used by governments to check the pandemic in Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. In Chhattisgarh, which is currently India’s second-largest Covid hot spot after Maharashtra, the administration in Raipur district imposed an 11-day complete lockdown.

              " ' Book civic chiefs for manual scavenging deaths: HC  Chennai The Madras high court on Wednesday said that civic heads of corporations and municipalities must be booked if any more deaths occur due to manual scavenging “irrespective of whether engaged by them or (a) contractor”.The bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations while dealing with a batch of pending petitions filed against manual scavenging with one of the petitioners being the pan-Indian non-governmental organisation Safai Karamchari Andolan. Manual scavenging has been banned since 1993 in India but it continues unabated with several deaths reported due to asphyxiation. By February 2021, Tamil Nadu had registered six deaths due to manual scavenging.The court stated that it was inclined to find a permanent solution for which it asked the state government to procure equipment tailor-made for cleaning the sewage system or overhaul the current method.The counsel for the state government, Jayaprakash Narayan informed the court that a circular has been issued that work orders of contractors will be cancelled and they will be blacklisted if they engage manual scavengers. He added that the state is mobilising funds to procure machinery for cleaning sewerage. The matter was adjourned for two weeks as the petitioner Safai Karamchari Andolan sought more time to respond to replies filed by the state government and the Greater Chennai Corporation on the issue. The NGO’s counsel told the court that there had been no deaths due to manual scavenging since the court’s last order on the issue on March 16. The court asked the state as well as the NGO to give inputs so that it could issue guidelines to “put this nonsense to a complete end”.In its previous order, the court said it was “high time” that heads of corporations and municipalities were held “personally liable” for deaths due to manual scavenging within their jurisdiction and face immediate arrest on criminal charges. The Madras high court’s order was long overdue, said Safai Karamchari Andolan activists. “We are very happy with the order passed today,” said its national co-convener Deepthi Sukumar. “Whenever there is a death, the government blames the contractor. The order fixes accountability and is an important measure in preventing deaths inside sewers.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

They found $8,000 during the search and tried to flee with it,” said the officer.As the suspects fled, the woman tried to chase them but she was allegedly assaulted. The suspects escaped in their car with the money even as the couple contacted their language interpreter in Delhi.The police were subsequently alerted and a case of robbery was registered.

              " ' Rahul to begin ‘active’ campaign for Bengal soon, says functionary  New Delhi Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will “actively” campaign in West Bengal for the ongoing assembly elections but only towards the last few phases to focus on the party’s strongholds, key functionaries said on Wednesday. Polling in the state, which is being held in eight phases, began on March 27 and will continue till April 29. The former Congress president has so far campaigned in the remaining three poll-bound states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam, and in the Union territory of Puducherry where the stakes remain high for the Grand Old Party. Gandhi is likely to visit Bengal only after the fifth phase. The Congress strongholds in Bengal are in a few districts such as Malda, Murshidabad, North Dinajpur and parts of north Bengal.Polling in these seats will take place in the last three phases.“He is definitely going. He will do a good campaign and the plans (for the same) are underway,” a key member of his team said, preferring anonymity. Former Bengal Congress unit chief Pradip Bhattacharya said: “For us, the main battle starts after the fifth phase. We have already finished primary talks with Rahul’s team about his campaign.” In Bengal, the Congress is fighting in 92 of the 294 seats in agreement with the Communist Party of India CPI(M)-led Left Front. In 2016, the Congress had bagged 44 seats while the Left had secured 26 seats.The two parties, however, have emerged as main rivals in Kerala. This has also added to speculations whether Gandhi will hold any joint campaign with the Left in Bengal.“The unwritten understanding is we will talk about the Bengal plan only after the Kerala elections are over. Even now, it’s psychologically too close to discuss Bengal with the top Congress leadership,” a senior CPI(M) leader said, preferring anonymity.While Abbas Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front (ISF) is also a part of the front and has got 38 seats from the Left, the Congress has tried to keep itself aloof from the new party. Congress leaders insist that Gandhi too will not share the dais with the ISF during his poll campaign. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Delhi adds 5,506 Covid-19 cases, 20 more deaths  The fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to surge in Delhi, with cases hitting a fresh high for the year on Wednesday after 5,506 new infections were recorded.The seven-day rolling average of infections also crossed the 4,000 mark, which is for the first time since December 4 last year, indicating the return of the city’s Covid graph to levels not seen since the third wave that lasted from October to December in 2020.With a little over 90,000 tests, the city’s positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among the total samples tested — also shot up to 6.1%, on Wednesday, the highest since December 1.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a test positivity rate below 5% for a two-week period for an infection to be considered under control in an area. Delhi crossed this threshold on Monday for the first time in 124 days. The positivity rate dropped just below 5% on Tuesday, on the back of a record 103,453 new tests.Delhi’s fourth wave has seen infections rise sharply, with the number of cases increasing from less than 1,000 to over 5,000 within 16 days, showed Delhi government data.“Delhi, where there were less than 200 cases for two to three months, has crossed the 5,000 mark within three weeks. The infection has been around for a year and we know that the best way to protect oneself is to wear a mask and maintain social distance. I urge people to follow these precautions,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.Delhi also added 20 more deaths of Covid-19 to its toll, taking the overall fatality count to 11,133 on Wednesday.More than 15 people died of the infection on average daily over the last seven days. In comparison, 7.7 deaths were recorded on average daily the week before and 3.5 deaths the week before that.“The increase in the number of deaths always follows the curve of the infection. The severity of the infection is at the peak between the eighth and 12th day, so if the incidence is high today, the impact on deaths will be seen 10 days later,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).He added that mortalities have been fewer this year because people are more aware and reach hospitals on time. Health care facilities also have clinical protocols in place for appropriate treatment.The number of people hospitalised has been increasing sharply too along with the number of cases.Almost 3,000 beds have been added over the last one week; the occupancy has hovered at around 46% however.“The bed situation is getting worse by the day. Everything is gradually filling up as the number of cases goes up. Hospitals are again moving from non-Covid to Covid services,” said Dr Anant Mohan, head of the pulmonology department at AIIMS.The number of people in home isolation crossed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday. There are over 19,400 people living with the infection currently in Delhi. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics new delhi coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' EC notice to Mamata over ‘split Muslim vote’ remark  Kolkata: The Election Commission of India sent a notice to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday for her alleged appeal to the minority community, while campaigning in Hooghly, to not allow a split in their votes among different political parties. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief has been asked to respond to the notice within the next 48 hours.“The commission gives you an opportunity to explain your stand in making the statement within 48 hours of receipt of the notice, failing which the commission shall take a decision without further reference to you,” the notice stated. During an election rally at Tarakeshwar in Hooghly on April 3, Banerjee allegedly appealed to the Muslim voters to not let their votes get split among different political parties. “I appeal to my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands. Don’t split the minority votes listening to the devil, who is moving around with BJP’s money. He makes many communal statements and triggers clashes between the Hindus and Muslims,” she said.Soon after the rally, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) delegation, led by Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, lodged a complaint with the EC alleging that Banerjee was demanding votes on “communal grounds”. In its letter to the CM, the poll panel said that her statement was found to be in violation of the provisions contained in Section 123(3), 3(A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and clauses 2,3,4 of Part 1 of General Conduct of Model Code of Conduct for the guidance of political parties and candidates. Polling in the state, which is being held in eight phases, began on March 27 and will continue till April 29. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, attacked Banerjee over the same comment. “Dear Didi, recently you said all Muslims should unite, and not allow their votes to be divided. You are saying this means that you are convinced that the Muslim vote bank has also gone out of your hands, the Muslims have also turned away from you,” Modi said while addressing an election rally in north Bengal.The TMC, however, hit back at the EC and the BJP over the notice. “Mamatadi issued notice by @ECISVEEP on @BJP’s complaint. What about TMC complaints of 1. Video evidence of BJP candidate distributing cash 2. Cash coupons distributed to attend BJP mtng & vote. Gentlemen - at least keep up the farce of impartiality!” Mahua Moitra, TMC MP, tweeted on Wednesday evening SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Covid-19: Few follow the rules at Delhi’s busy weekly markets  New Delhi: On Wednesday, when the national capital reported over 5500 fresh Covid-19 cases at a positivity rate of 6.10%, many weekly markets across the city were packed to capacity, with most shoppers clearly flouting social distancing norms. HT visited two such markets and saw poor compliance of social distancing protocols with shoppers jostling with each other for space. Last week, the Delhi government identified weekly markets among several super-spreader areas where enforcement efforts and awareness campaigns were required. At the weekly Wednesday market in Govindpuri, mask discipline was poor with little to no social distancing, despite public address systems relaying announcements about standard operating procedures. Tina, 18, a resident of Govindpuri, who was at the market along with her siblings and mothers, said that the market was crowded as usual despite the government confirming that Delhi was witnessing the fourth wave of the infection. “The market is usually crowded on Wednesday. If you go by the crowds, you’d think that the pandemic is over,” said Tina, who goes by her first name. She said that while there were announcements reminding people to maintain physical distancing, shoppers were not mindful of the rules. Pooja Jaiswal, another visitor, who was seen without a mask, said that she was surprised by the footfall at the market. “I’m in Delhi for a short visit and decided to do some essential shopping. I didn’t anticipate that the market would be crowded to this extent,” said Jaiswal. Vendors in the market, however, said that they were reminding visitors to wear masks and follow all protocols. “Out of 100 people, if 2-3 people are not wearing a mask, we cannot blame the entire market. We can’t do much if someone doesn’t want to follow the rules,” said Manish Kumar, who runs a fabric shop during the weekly market. Kumar said that night curfew, which started on Tuesday night, will have terrible consequences for vendors who were already facing losses.“Things were getting back on track for us since January but once again, they are going downhill. Due to the curfew, our earnings will be reduced by 50%. We are following all protocols but continue to suffer. Since it’s summer, people use to step out to shop in the evening around 6-7 pm. By the time, we start selling, it’s already 8 pm and by 9 pm, we need to start wrapping up. When will sell our goods?” said Kumar. The government has imposed night curfew until April 30 across Delhi, from 10pm till 5 am. At the weekly market at Sadiq Nagar, lack of mask discipline was the main concern. A significant number of people were seen lowering down the mask to speak or they had worn it incorrectly. Due to a relatively lesser crowd, visitors maintained sufficient distance from one another. Delhi police officials were making announcements at the market. “We are reminding people about the curfew timings so that they can return home well in time,” said a police official, who did not wish to be identified. Shopkeepers said that social distancing was not a problem since limited people were stepping out due to the recent surge in cases. They said that while protocols were being followed, the business had suffered. “If 80% of our customers used to come earlier, only around 20% come now. The numbers have reduced after Holi. Our earnings have been affected and will further reduce if restrictions continue,” said Suresh Kumar, 69, who runs a grocery shop at the weekly market. Kumar said that the government had not taken any steps for the welfare of hawkers despite the losses they had suffered in the past year. Another shopkeeper, Baleshwar Singh Yadav, said the footfall has gone down due to the fear of Covid-19. Yadav said the curfew was detrimental to the business of hawkers. “The fear of Covid-19 has set in again. They (shoppers) are not stepping out anyway. To add to our miseries, the government has imposed a curfew,” said Yadav. Ramesh Kumar, head of the South Delhi Weekly Market association, said all vendors had been given directives to enforce SOPs and they were doing the same. Kumar said that the association had arranged for public address systems at different markets to ensure that rules are followed. “We have hired people to manage crowds and also make announcements regularly through the speaker. We are following all rules but the government should think of our welfare too. If we set up our markets at 6-7 pm and start wrapping up by 9 pm, we hardly get any time to conduct business. Our livelihood depends on these markets. The government should think about us as well,” said Kumar RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said that the local police were trying to curb social distancing violation at the weekly markets by prosecuting violators aggressively. “With the district administration, we are dishing out challans to as many violators as we are able to. We already have a public announcement system in place, but we are trying to dissuade them from being careless by fining them,” said Meena.The Delhi government did not comment on the matter.

              " \" Police fan out to spread the word as Delhi adjusts to night curfew  From making announcements asking people to reach homes early to issuing fines to violators, the first two days of the implementation of the night curfew in the capital saw teams of Delhi police personnel hitting the roads much before the restrictions started at 10pm on Tuesday and Wednesday.Led by district deputy commissioners of police (DCP), the police teams were spotted in prominent markets like Connaught Place and Khan Market, in addition to other important stretches across the city. Officers said multiple teams have been formed at every police station to check curfew violations.The night curfew -- from 10pm to 5am -- till April 30 was ordered by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease.Data shared by the police showed that police filed 200 FIRs, temporarily detained 534 violators and fined 842 people for not wearing masks on the first day of the night curfew. Police said the focus on Tuesday night was on informing people about the new rule, adding that more teams will be posted on the roads from Wednesday night.Owners and management of banquet halls, restaurants, bars and shopkeepers in markets were among those against whom FIRs were filed under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Disaster Management Act.Also Read| 'Parties were being held': Delhi health minister on why night curfew was imposedPolice said that almost all the 1,000 police control room (PCR) vans spread out across most market places in the city, using their loud speakers to advise people to stay indoors. In southeast Delhi, police teams coordinated with managements of gurdwaras, temples and mosques to inform citizens about the curfew rules.Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said police across the city are stringently following the DDMA directions on the curfew.In New Delhi area, which has prominent markets such as Connaught Place and Khan Market, district DCP Eish Singhal said, “Before 10pm, our officers had started making announcements. Through word of mouth, news of the curfew had spread and most people complied with the rules. We issued 76 challans and registered one case. Our intention is not to just prosecute people, it is also to ensure that they start complying with the rules and head back home on their own well in time before the 10pm deadline.”In north Delhi, police focused on ensuring that only people engaged in essential services were on the road. “We ensured that vehicles engaged in delivery of essential items were not stopped. Many vehicles take the Ring Road (that passes through north Delhi and connects the national Capital with nearby state of Haryana) to enter or leave Delhi and we helped such goods pass the district without any hindrance. We also visited markets in the Walled City and ensured that only people engaged in essential services were on the road. There are trucks that load and unload items that come under essential services in Old Delhi market. We did not face any problems as people were cooperative. We issued around 40-45 challans against those who were flouting the night curfew rules,” said the north district’s DCP, Anto Alphonse.In southeast Delhi, which has areas such as Lajpat Nagar, New Friends Colony and Jamia Nagar, the curfew rules were announced from loudspeakers of masjids, gurdwaras and temples. The guidelines issued by DDMA were circulated among locals through social media. “All streets, passages and subways connecting the main roads were blocked using barricades to restrict the movement of vehicles for better imposition of night curfew,” said the south east district’s DCP RP Meena.Each district administration also deployed teams on Wednesday to enforce the rules.“The respective MCDs have been asked to ensure restaurants and markets are shut by 10pm. Further, SDMs have been directed to be on the field from 9pm to midnight to monitor the situation. Teams have also been deployed from the DM’s office to assist the police. Also, the district control room will work round-the-clock at the DM’s office to monitor the curfew and to issue e-passes,” said another revenue official.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said the seven-hour-long curfew was imposed in the capital as people were found organising parties and other events where Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, were often ignored. “The night curfew has been imposed because there were reports about parties, which cause unnecessary gatherings and put people in close contact. Hence the night curfew is aimed to avoid this situation because if even one is positive among the 50 people, all 50 would test positive,” he said while interacting with reporters.Also Read| Night curfew in Delhi to control Covid-19 spread. See picturesGovernment officials, essential workers and those travelling to airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres and hospitals are exempt from the seven-hour night curfew, with some requiring e-passes. The order mandates all restaurants, markets, wedding halls, pubs and commercial establishments to shut by 10pm.Pending e-passes adds to worryMeanwhile, a large number of people complained of not getting e-passes despite applying through the Delhi government website -- www.delhi.gov.in -- on Wednesday. Some even queued up at various DMs’ offices, hoping to get the pass.“The application status keeps showing ‘pending’. I work in a medical shop in Rajouri Garden which remains open round-the-clock. Now, because my e-pass is getting delayed, I have to shut my store at 9pm itself today because my staff and I will need at least one hour to reach our homes. I hope the government expedites the e-pass system,” said Ritesh Singh, an owner of a medical store.Data showed that till Wednesday noon, the 11 districts of Delhi had collectively received 73,154 applications for e-passes, out of which 6,133 were approved, 34,759 were rejected and 30,940 were pending.A senior revenue official said that the pendency is also because of certain grey areas for which different districts have raised queries. “The revenue headquarters has received queries from district administrations on whether e-passes should be granted for food delivery persons, airport cargo transport, weddings and so on. Other queries also include whether construction activities and operation of small factories and production units should be allowed during the curfew hours. A detailed clarification on these issues are likely to be issued on Thursday,” said the official on condition of anonymity.When asked about the pendency in applications and issues with the government website, Jain said, “It has begun from yesterday only. So, I think these teething problems will be sorted out in a day or two.”Talking about the effectiveness of the night curfew, the health minister said such curbs cannot be limited to certain parts of the city. “It has to be applied to all of Delhi. However it has been done only for the time being and we will analyse the impact. It is not a harsh decision as people generally finish their work by 10pm. Taxis are allowed and if someone is coming from outside and have valid tickets, they can travel. For restaurants and hotels, the timing is anyway 11pm. I believe that the condition of the virus spread is not mellow, so we have to be aware and careful. People talk in extremes, either they are in favour of a complete lockdown or none at all. There has to be a middle ground as well,” Jain said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi news coronavirus \",\n",
              " ' Delhi govt hospitals restrict non-Covid services, cut OPD hours  With cases of Covid-19 on the rise in the capital city, non-Covid services have once again been affected as hospitals have started restricting the number of patients being seen at outpatient clinics, reduced the number of elective surgeries, and reassigned beds and manpower for the treatment of the viral infection. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was the first to stop walk-in registrations at its clinics on Tuesday, which was followed by hospitals such as Lady Hardinge Medical College and Lok Nayak limiting the number of patients registering for their clinics. At Lok Nayak hospital, the registration timing has been cut by half-an-hour to 10.30am from the earlier 11am. The number of patients being allowed into clinics has also been restricted to 50 existing patients and 50 new patients, according to a senior administrator. At Lady Hardinge Medical College, the number of patients allowed per department has been restricted to 150. The timing for registration has been reduced -- it is now 8am to 10am instead 8am to noon. For special clinics – ones meant for specific diseases such as diabetes and club foot – the registrations will be limited to 50 persons, according to an order by the hospital director Dr NN Mathur. A senior doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, “There is very limited space available at the hospital. The number of patients is being restricted to ensure that there is no crowding. Patients will also be given time slots to ensure that they enter the building in a staggered manner.” In addition to restricting clinics, the hospitals have also started cutting down on routine elective surgeries. According to the administrator from Lok Nayak hospital, the number of non-emergency planned surgeries will be halved to ensure that adequate staff is available for the 1,000 beds that were recently earmarked for Covid-19 patients. The hospital had been converted entirely into a Covid-19 facility last year. From 2,000 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid, it was reduced to 300 in January after the city’s positivity rate dropped below 1%. All routine surgeries have been deferred by a week at Lady Hardinge Medical College. “When the pressure on one service increases, we have to reduce the burden on other services. We have to cut down on the number of surgeries to free up anaesthetists who have to take care of Covid-19 patients,” said a doctor from the hospital, asking not to be named. AIIMS is also diverting more manpower and infrastructure for treatment of Covid. The minutes of a meeting of the hospital’s task force, on Tuesday, read, “Beds occupied by non-Covid patients to be vacated at the earliest to accommodate Covid suspects/cases as was being done previously… Non-Covid work needs to be reduced to redirect resources for Covid areas.” The new private ward has been opened for isolation and quarantine of health care workers who are either Covid-19 positive or suspected to have the infection. Holding areas for suspected patients, till their reports come, has also been restarted at the hospital, according to the minutes. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' As Covid-19 cases rise, Delhi health minister Jain warns of another peak  With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) spreading at a fast pace in the state, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday expressed concerns that the new cases may cross the previous record of 8,593 recorded on November 11 last year.“In Delhi, where less than 200 cases were being reported each day for two to three months, the number has crossed the 5,000 mark within three weeks. The pace at which the cases are increasing, we worry that it might break the previous record. We cannot say anything for sure, but many other states have a higher positivity rate than Delhi,” said Jain.“Delhi’s positivity rate is 5%, it’s 25% in Maharashtra and 16% in Chhattisgarh; many states have a positivity of over 10%. If the positivity rate in Delhi increases to that level, think about the situation we will be in,” he added.Delhi reported 5,506 cases on Wednesday after conducting over 90,000 tests, putting the positivity rate at 6.10%. This is the highest positivity rate the city has seen since December 1. The city also saw 20 deaths on Wednesday.The government has already directed officials to increase the number of beds in 11 government and 54 private sector hospitals. The city has already added over 2,000 beds in the last two to three days and another 2,000 are likely to be added in the next couple of days, taking the total number of available beds for Covid patients to around 10,000.The government has also instituted a night curfew between 10pm and 5am. “There were reports of people partying. What happens when people gather in large numbers and are in close contact unnecessarily? Even if one person is positive and 50 people have gathered, all of them get it. The measure is not for a long time, but for a short while to control the number of cases. We will see what the impact of the night curfew is. It is not a harsh step. People usually finish all their work before 10pm. This step is between a complete lockdown and complete relaxation,” said Jain.He also informed that 84,213 Covid vaccine shots were administered till 10 pm on Tuesday, of which 75% were given in government centres and 25% in private hospitals.“People over the age of 45 years need the vaccine more, but those between 18 and 45 are getting infected now. It is spreading among them because they are mobile. They are not getting a severe disease but they spread it to their parents, grandparents,” the minister said.

              " ' Food corporation not procuring wheat at MSP in Delhi, alleges Rai  Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday alleged that the Food Corporation of India (FCI), which comes under the central government, has not yet opened counters for procurement of wheat at Delhi’s grain markets at the minimum support price (MSP) – an allegation that was denied by the Union ministry of food and public distribution and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).MSP is the assured price at which the government buys major farm produce to give farmers assured returns for their yield. It also acts as a base price for private traders.MSP applies to 23 crops, which include paddy and wheat.“FCI has not opened a single counter for wheat procurement in Delhi, yet it is making false claims of purchasing the crops at MSP rates from April 1. Despite three letters of plea addressed to the FCI, it has not opened its wheat procurement counters, forcing farmers to sell their wheat below MSP through commissioning agents. The central government determines the MSP and the FCI purchases, but the BJP is falsely accusing the Delhi government of not buying wheat at MSP,” said Rai, who is in charge of the agriculture department in Delhi.“This is the reality of the Prime Minister’s assurances of buying crops at MSP. This is why it is imperative to have a law for MSP. It is our demand that the Central government begin purchasing wheat at MSP from Najafgarh and Narela Mandi, and also investigate and act against those making false claims of shops opening in Delhi from April 1,” said Rai, expressing solidarity with farmer groups who have gathered at Delhi’s borders against three contentious farm laws passed in the Parliament and demanding a new law concerning MSP.However, a spokesperson of the Union ministry of food and public distribution dismissed the allegation and said, “The contentions of Delhi state government are not true.In fact the FCI Delhi region is fully prepared to procure wheat from farmers of Delhi at three centres -- FSD Mayapuri, FSD Narela and APMC Najafgarh mandi,which have been completely operational from April 1, 2021. Till date, 158 quintals of wheat from FSD Narela has been purchased by FCI Delhi region.”The Delhi BJP said in a press statement, “FCI has started the purchase of wheat at MSP in Narela from April 5. On the other hand, farmers in Delhi are still looking forward to the fulfilment of two promises made by the Kejriwal government. First, the payment of 50% over and above MSP to farmers and, second, free electricity for irrigation lines. Tomorrow (Thursday), Delhi BJP’s Kisan Morcha will hold a demonstration near the chief minister’s residence demanding payment of 50% above MSP and free electricity for farmers.”Delhi has around 800 hectares of agricultural land, show government records. Most of it is located in the western, northern and north-west peripheries of the city. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Covid-19 protocols in place inside schools, social distancing norms flouted outside  While Delhi schools have started taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of students appearing in the ongoing offline pre-boards and practical exams, amid the spike Covid-19 cases, many parents raised concerns about the physical distancing norm being violated outside several schools in the national capital. Currently, students of classes 9 to 12 (academic year 2020-21) are allowed to visit schools for examinations and board exam preparations. While the majority of private schools in Delhi have already completed their class 9 and 11 exams, the only students going to school are those in classes 10 and 12, whose practical exams are underway. In government schools, students of classes 9 to 12 are going to school for their practicals, pre-boards, and mid-term examinations.Despite clear guidelines from the directorate of education (DoE) for ensuring the entry and exit of students in a staggered manner, large groups of students can be seen outside many schools, violating physical distancing norms. Outside the government girls’ school in east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave, a large number of students could be seen without face masks and standing in groups on Wednesday afternoon. Similar scenes were seen outside several schools at ITO, Minto Road, Jasola, and Subhash Nagar, among other areas.Anju Chaudhary, the mother of a class 9 student at a government school in Subhash Nagar, said, “I had gone to pick my son from school on Wednesday after his midterm exam and I saw students standing in large groups without maintaining any distance. We have heard in the news that students of many schools have tested Covid-19 positive recently and the violation of norms makes me fearful about the safety of my son. The government should either postpone the exams or instruct schools to ensure the safety of children. ”Many parents shared similar concerns. Sushil Kumar, the father of a class 12 student at a private school in Jasola, said, “My daughter is going to the school for her practical exams these days and I have seen how students violate the mask rule and social distancing norms outside the school. It makes me doubt the precautions being taken inside the school as well. She has to appear for her board exams from May 4. What will happen if something unfortunate happens now?”Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents’ Association, said the government should either postpone the exams or issue fresh guidelines to schools. “This fresh wave of Covid-19 is scary. Several cases have been reported among students and teachers in the past few days,” she said.At least seven students tested positive for Covid-19 at Arya Kanya Gurukul in New Rajender Nagar on Monday. The principal and some staff members of another private school, DAV Sreshta Vihar, had also been tested Covid-19 positive last week. Besides, another private school in west Delhi on Monday cancelled a scheduled exam after a class 12 student tested positive. Several principals said it is a challenge for them to ensure physical distancing outside the school premises. The principal of a government school in Karawal Nagar said, “Most of our teachers are busy with invigilation work, while others are busy with distribution of books, ration and even Covid-19 related work. It’s not possible for schools to deploy staff members outside the campus to ensure enforcement of social distancing norms. It would be better if the government could deploy some civil defence volunteers for the purpose.”A senior official at the Delhi government’s education department, who asked not to be named, said, “It’s not possible for the government to postpone practical exams of board classes at a time when the CBSE board exams are near. Schools have already been directed to strictly abide by the Covid-19 protocols. The government might consider the ongoing midterm exams for class 9 and 11 as their final exams if the situation continues to remain the same.”Meanwhile, officials at several schools, both government and private, said they have stepped up the Covid-19 preventive measures. Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in Tilak Nagar, said, “We have fixed seats for every student so that they can directly go to their assigned room, sit at their assigned seat and take the exam. We have also assigned duties to our staff at the gates to ensure students do not stand in groups while entering and leaving the school premises.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Will not demolish Lal Masjid, Centre informs Delhi HC  The Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that it will not demolish the Lal Masjid, an ancient mosque situated on a disputed land near Lodhi Road in the national capital.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma told justice Sanjeev Sachdeva that the Union government will not demolish the mosque till April 29, when the case will be next heard by the court.The submission came on a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board, challenging the demolition order of the mosque in village Aliganj, alongside Link Road. The Waqf Board plea, filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, said even when the land dispute is pending before the Waqf Tribunal, the Centre and the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) have asked them to vacate the mosque as the structure was going to be demolished.On Tuesday, the court asked the Centre and the CRPF if they had plans to demolish the mosque.The Waqf petition has also said since time immemorial, the land in question has been occupied by a graveyard and the Lal Masjid. However, in 2017, the land of the graveyard was taken over by the Centre, a dispute which is pending adjudication before the Waqf Tribunal.On Tuesday, appearing for the Waqf Board, senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose submitted that even though the tribunal was made functional and appointments were made on court orders, since December 2020, the tribunal is not operational as the posts of two members are lying vacant.He had said the Centre’s Land and Development Officer (L&DO)is taking advantage of the situation and on March 31, the SHO of Basti Nizamuddin police station visited the site and told the imam that the mosque will be demolished since the area was to be used by CRPF for canteen, barracks and parking.He sought that the tribunal be constituted and the matter be decided before taking any untoward step.On Wednesday, justice Sachdeva, while taking on record the statement of the ASG, also asked the Delhi government to expedite the filling of vacancies in the Waqf Tribunal. The court posted the matter for further hearing to April 29. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' AAP protests against Covid-19 vaccine exports  The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday protested outside the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) headquarters against the Centre’s decision to export Covid-19 vaccines, and urged that the jabs be made available for all adults in the country. The BJP, however, alleged that AAP workers were not wearing masks or distancing during the protest.The Delhi Police broke up the protest, arguing that no gatherings in the city are allowed, as per Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) orders.Senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the country’s population of 1.3 billion has the first right over Covid-19 vaccines that have been produced and manufactured by scientists in India.“Before Pakistan and Afghanistan, every Indian citizen has the right to get vaccinated first. It is being said that one of the widespread variants of coronavirus is affecting children below the age of 15. Today, the number of Covid-19 cases in India is among the highest in the world, because of which the country is getting defamed globally. But instead, the Centre is planning to export the vaccine to 68 countries only for the Prime Minister to gain applause,” he said.The Delhi BJP, however, lashed out at the AAP for allegedly shirking Covid norms.“The people of Delhi are questioning the double standards of the AAP. On one hand, the AAP government is slapping fines of up to ₹2,000 on people for not wearing masks. On the other, the party is holding protests where no one is wearing a mask or distancing,” said Praveen Shankar Kapoor, of the Delhi BJP. htc SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics aam aadmi party ',\n",
              " ' Civic bodies keep crematoriums ready to cope with possible rise in Covid death toll  Taking note of the steep rise in Covid-19 cases, and apprehending a similar rise in related fatalities, Delhi’s three civic bodies on Wednesday said they are prepared to deal with any additional toll if the need arises. Authorities of the north, east and south civic bodies said they have resources to handle 450-500 Covid-19 fatalities (confirmed and suspected) every day across their 21 facilities — crematoriums and burial grounds. According to the daily health bulletin, the city recorded 5,506 cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday and 20 deaths. The city recorded the highest single-day death on November 18 last year, during the third wave of the infection in the city, when 131 people succumbed to the infection. As new infections and deaths peaked during the third wave, crematoriums struggled to cope with the increased fatalities. The Delhi high court, too, had asked the government to indicate steps it had taken to manage crematoriums and graveyards in the national capital.During the third wave, people had to wait outside crematoriums and cemeteries for five to six hours to conduct the last rites of loved ones who succumbed to the virus.Covid-19 deaths have increased sharply in the Capital over the past few weeks, since the outbreak of the fourth wave. In the first week of March, the Capital recorded less than two daily deaths of the infection. This number jumped to 15 in the first week of April, giving rise to fears that the city’s crematoriums have struggle to meet demands, if the spike continues.“Seeing the current steep rise in Covid-19 cases, we cannot help but be apprehensive about the possibility of the death toll rising as well. So, we have made standby arrangements. At Nigambodh Ghat, we have opened three more CNG furnaces, taking the total count to six. We have also increased the number of platforms for cremation to 120 from 104,” Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said.He said their crematoriums and graveyards can perform nearly 200 last rites a day.Data from the three civic bodies showed that there are 21 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (confirmed and suspected) are being cremated or buried. Of these, eight facilities are under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, eight under the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). Officials said these facilities can dispose of the bodies of nearly 400 people who have died of Covid-19, if operating at full capacity. “We have eight facilities, including crematoriums and burial grounds, where Covid-19 bodies are disposed of. These facilities can handle 215 bodies per day. We have also made additional arrangements to perform last rites of Covid-19 victims,” Narendra Chawla, leader of the house, SDMC, said.He said that a new CNG crematorium, with two furnaces, was inaugurated in Green Park in February, and the facility can be converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility if required.Sandeep Kapoor, former chairman standing committee, EDMC, said the civic body has dedicated five crematoriums and graveyards for Covid-19 victims and added that there is no rush at any of the facilities so far.“We will increase the number of wood pyres if need be. We have also ample space available in graveyards and, so far, there is no cause to worry,” Kapoor said.Experts, however, say the city is better prepared this time around to keep the Covid fatalities low. “We still cannot be sure whether the disease is less severe this time around. However, the case fatality ratio is definitely lower now as compared to the first wave of cases (last March-April). This is because the hospitals were not well equipped back then; there was a shortage of PPE kits, beds, non-invasive and invasive ventilators. The treatment protocol had also not been finalised -- now we know what to do at what stage of the disease. Also, people have become more aware. They are coming to the hospitals on time; almost everyone has a pulse oximeter to monitor their oxygen saturation,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

Names and personal details of protected witnesses are redacted in their statements.The high court, which had on March 18 reserved its order on Tanha’s bail plea, had asked the police to file written submissions, unredacted copies of witness statements and other relevant documents.During the proceedings, the court also frowned on the prosecution for the absence of unredacted statements of the witnesses with them.Special public prosecutor (SPP) Rajat Nair, representing the police, said these are protected witnesses and the unredacted copies are with the trial court only. He pointed out that when the investigating officer had applied for protection of witnesses, the statements were signed and sealed by the trial court judge and redacted copies were given to the investigation officer.Tanha has challenged a trial court’s October 26, 2020, order which dismissed his bail application.

              " ' To bolster cooperation in Indo-Pacific and counter China, Japan PM Suga to visit India  Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to visit India in either late April or early May as part of efforts to bolster cooperation across the Indo-Pacific to counter China’s aggressive actions, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. This would be the first visit by a top Japanese leader to India since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, and also the first since a planned summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his former Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Guwahati in December 2019 was called off because of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Modi and Suga have spoken several times on phone amid the pandemic and also participated in the first virtual summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on March 12 along with US President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Both India and Japan are committed to efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific and this is expected to be a key part of the agenda for Suga’s visit, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The exact dates for Suga’s visit are being finalised through diplomatic channels though a final decision will also hinge on the Covid-19 situation, the people said. Like India, which has been engaged in a standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for almost a year, Japan has its own concerns over aggressive Chinese actions in the waters off Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. The joint statement issued after the Quad Summit has said the four members of the group will “facilitate collaboration, including in maritime security, to meet challenges to the rules-based maritime order in the East and South China Seas”. Japan has invested ₹1,600 crore in development projects across India’s northeastern states and is also working closely with India on infrastructure projects in third countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India and Japan also signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) last September for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces. Suga, who will visit Washington for talks with Biden on April 16, is keen to bolster cooperation with the US, Australia and India to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the region, the people said. Suga is also expected to visit the Philippines, which too has been coping with China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' DMRC steps up measures to ensure social distancing on trains, inside stations  With Covid-19 cases in the city on an upward spiral, the Delhi Metro has stepped up crowd control measures to ensure social distancing inside stations and aboard trains, including increasing the number of enforcement teams and temporarily shutting entry into Metro stations to limit crowds.The Delhi Metro’s ridership has increased consistently since the service resumed operations in September 2020 after the lockdown. Data seen by HT shows that the average passenger journey in September last year was 619,242, but it crossed 2.6 million in March this year.The increase in the number of commuters, officials admit, has made crowd management challenging. The Metro on Tuesday temporarily closed entry to four stations on the Yellow line (Samaypur Badli to HUDA City Centre) to control the swelling crowds.While entry to Patel Chowk, Chandni Chowk, New Delhi and Chawri Bazaar stations was closed for around 10 minutes, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials said passengers were allowed to deboard trains and exit the stations. “This is part of our crowd control measures to ensure social distancing at the stations and on trains,” said a DMRC official.DMRC officials said that though passenger journeys have increased since September, they are still just around 50% of the numbers recorded during the corresponding period last year. For instance, the Metro recorded 4.3 million passenger journeys in March 2020.With the Delhi government on Tuesday imposing a night curfew between 10pm and 5am, the Metro body expects the number of commuters to drop as well. According to the state government’s guidelines, only essential service providers with valid ID cards and government-issued passes are allowed to travel in the Metro after 10pm.The DMRC has also stepped up measures to check for Covid-19 protocol violations.“We now have seven teams — up from four earlier — to crack down on violations. The number of penalties issued has increased considerably in March, when cases began to increase,” said a DMRC official.In September last year, 5,180 people were penalised for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. But in January and February this year, the numbers dropped to 3,131 and 2,823 respectively. But the number of penalties has again increased. A senior DMRC official said, “In March, we penalised 7,058 people for violating Covid protocols. Since we resumed operations, 29,267 people have been penalised.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi metro coronavirus ',\n",

CETPs have been found not complying with prescribed effluent standards even after repeated directions being given by the DPCC. The Delhi government has found CETPs to be non-functional or not properly functioning, as a result of which the Yamuna is getting more polluted,” said Rai in a press statement.He further said the compensation was calculated on the basis of monthly analysis reports of the DPCC. “CETPs play a key role in treating the polluted waters from the industries, and, therefore, the prescribed effluent standards must be maintained. After repeated interventions in cases where they have not complied with our directions, stern action has been taken and we will monitor the situation,” Rai said.According to Rai, 13 CETPs, with a total capacity of 212.3 MLD (million litres daily), are in operation in Delhi. The CETPs, which are in Wazirpur, Mayapuri, Bawana, Narela, SMA, GTK, Okhla, Mangolpuri, Nangloi, Badli, Jhilmil, Lawrence Road and Naraina, have been constructed to treat industrial effluent/wastewater generated in the 17 industrial areas of Delhi.While 11 of them are managed by cooperative societies, two are operated by a private limited company.

He was assisted by Nilakanta Sharma who has been in good nick, showing his prowess as an attacking midfielder.In the following minute, a PC earned by India forward Lalit Upadyay saw Rupinder Pal Singh score a splendid goal, taking India's lead to 3-1 in the 14th minute.The second quarter began with both teams trading PCs with each other but none were successful. However, in the 23rd minute, Argentina's Lucas Toscani struck a fine goal to narrow India's lead to 3-2.Though India replied with aggressive attack, they were unable to create successful forays into the striking circle.Following the 10-minute halftime break, both teams vied to dominant with the ball and played on par with each other to keep the tempo up.It was eventually Argentina who succeeded in breaking the gridlock in this quarter by earning a PC which was well-struck by Argentina's attacking midfielder Ignacio Ortiz.The 3-3 equaliser didn't dampen India's spirit as they successfully scored the fourth goal via forward Dilpreet Singh who made a successful entry into the striking circle, earning India a PC in the 44th minute.Varun made no mistake in converting the goal and regaining the lead for India.With the visitors ahead only by a goal, the last quarter was a battle of nerves with the home team stepping on the gas to secure an equaliser.Though they created a PC in the early minutes of the fourth quarter, it was well-saved by India custodian Krishan Pathak but he could do little to stop Lucas's field goal in the 57th minute, thus ending the game in a 4-4 stalemate.India will next face Argentina in the FIH Hockey Pro League match on April 11 at 0130 IST.

The jail staff, designated front line workers, has already been vaccinated.However, with the number of inmates at its highest at 20,120 --- twice the jail’s sanctioned capacity of 10,026, experts have cautioned that immediate measures should be taken to decongest the prison so that adequate measures for isolating new inmates before being transferred to barracks are taken and social distancing is observed. Experts suggested that the government may consider releasing convicts on special parole and interim bail like last year when prisoners were released after the pandemic broke out.Last year, when the pandemic broke out, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole to ensure social distancing in jail. However, between February 6 and March 18, almost all have surrendered, leaving little space for isolation of suspected cases and new inmates, a second prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said.“With prison population increasing daily, breaking new records, it will be difficult to create space for isolation.The government should at least release those convicts who had surrendered on time in February,” the officer said.Advocate Ajay Verma, former convener of the National Forum for Prison Reforms -- a group of lawyers that fights for implementation of reforms across prisons — said, “The government should immediately start work on decongesting the jail. Prisoners who surrendered in February and March could be sent back temporarily again on parole on interim bail. If such prisoners did not pose a threat when they were out for nearly 10 months, why would they be a threat again. It is important to have social distancing in prison.”A second officer, who also requested to remain anonymous, said with thousands of prisoners who were released on special parole last year being back in jail, the situation has worsened. “We are on high alert and monitoring the health of all inmates. Between February 6 and March 18, around 6,000 prisoners surrendered after staying out of the jail for nearly a year. These prisoners were released on special parole and interim bail last year when the pandemic broke out, as one of the first measures to decongest the prison. During the first three waves of the infection, they were all out. It is an unfortunate coincidence that they have returned while the cases have started rising again,” the officer, who is also involved in the Covid containment measures, said.Until February, when the 6,000-odd prisoners were out on Covid-19 parole and interim bail, the prison department designated jail number 2 in Tihar complex and another jail at Mandoli for isolating new inmates. But now, these jails are packed with prisoners.Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel confirmed that 19 prisoners have tested Covid-19 positive and were admitted to different hospitals in the city.“As a precaution, we have admitted the prisoners to hospitals. The prison population has crossed 20,000 but we are taking all possible measures within the jail complex to ensure social distancing. Our officers are at work round-the-clock and checking for possible symptoms among prisoners.We conduct an extensive medical examination of all inmates once arrive at the prison. Those who show any flu-like symptoms are immediately quarantined,” the director general said.Officials said a separate drive to vaccinate prisoners above 45 years of age is also on. Until Tuesday evening, at least 161 prisoners above 45 have been vaccinated, they added. The jail hospital in sub-jail number 3 has been designated as a vaccination centre.Former Tihar law officer, Sunil Gupta, who worked in the prison for more than three decades, said, “It is important to decongest the prison. We have in the past used school buildings as temporary jails. If the population is now over 20,000, the authorities should not take any chances. During the Emergency, when the prison population was increasing, the jail administration had set up tents and created more spaces within the prison complex. Some steps have to be taken immediately.”Till date, two prisoners have died of Covid-19. As many as 293 jail officials, including the director general Goel, were infected but they have all recovered. At least 139 prisoners have been infected till date, according to the prison’s Covid data. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics tihar jail coronavirus ',\n",

Exam Regulatory Authority, UP has sent copies of its notification, issued on Wednesday, in this regard to all divisional joint directors (education) and district inspector of schools besides all divisional commissioners and district magistrates. The move comes following a green signal for the postponement of the recruitment exam given by the state government on April 6 that came through special secretary RV Singh in his missive sent to secretary of Exam Regulatory Authority. Earlier, the Exam Regulatory Authority, UP had sought permission to postpone the recruitment exams as the exam were being held close to the panchayat polls of 16 districts set to take place for April 19 and which could prevent thousands of government primary and upper primary teachers who are applicants from appearing in it due to their poll duties. Polling is set to be held in 16 districts of the state on April 19 in the second phase of the panchayat polls. These 16 districts, includes Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bijnor, Amroha, Badaun, Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Etawah, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot, Pratapgarh, Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur, Gonda, Maharajganj, Varanasi and Azamgarh. The proposal to postpone the recruitment exams had followed letters from various District Magistrates to Secretary of Examination Regulatory Authority, UP pointing out that the entire administrative machinery would be busy during the elections. Due to this, it would not be possible for them to conduct the examination on April 18. Hindustan Times had highlighted this issue in its report “Teachers in a fix over panchayat poll duty and recruitment exam” published on March 4. More than 3.25 lakh candidates have applied for this recruitment. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Through the reconstruction, the width of the bridge will be increased from 3.7 metres to 12 metres at a cost of ₹7 crore. Councillor Mamta Ashu and Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma, along with officials of GLADA, visited the site on Wednesday.Ashu said the current width of the bridge was quite narrow to deal with the traffic volume, which caused frequent snarls. “Areas surrounding Jhammat village have witnessed development of a large number of residential colonies and some educational institutions have also been established. This has contributed to more traffic movement,” she said.The matter was taken up by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in the past, following which officials of GLADA and irrigation department conducted a survey to resolve the traffic woes, she said.“The project has been divided into reconstruction of bridge and laying concrete on the approach roads connecting Jalandhar via Laddowal Bypass. GLADA will be the executive agency. Currently, work is at tendering stage. Construction will be completed within two months after issuance of the work order,” the councillor said.

              " ' UK govt insists vaccine program on track despite AstraZeneca restriction  The UK government said it remains on course to meet its Covid-19 vaccination targets, and moved quickly to assuage safety concerns after AstraZeneca doses were effectively ruled out for people under 30.“When you get the call, get the jab,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Wednesday on Twitter, shortly after the UK’s drug regulator issued its highly-anticipated safety review of Astra’s vaccine. The UK is “on track” to offer a first vaccine dose to all adults by the end of July, he said.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said 79 people among the more than 20 million who have received the Astra shot in Britain had suffered rare blood clots, 19 of whom had died. But while it found a “reasonably plausible link” to the vaccine, it did not block its usage.“No effective medicine or vaccine is without risk,” MHRA Chief Executive Officer June Raine told reporters.Instead, the government’s vaccine advisory committee recommended that people aged 18 to 29 should be offered an alternative vaccine where possible.The decision was a crucial one for Boris Johnson’s government, not least because Astra’s vaccine -- which was developed with Oxford University -- is the workhorse of the program and is made in the UK Meeting the inoculation target is also central to his ambition to fully reopen the economy on June 21.UK Recommends Not Using AstraZeneca Vaccine on Those Under 30The concern now will be whether confidence has been knocked in the Astra vaccine among people aged over 30 -- just as ministers prepare to unlock restaurants and shops that have been shuttered for months next week.Shops and hairdressers in England are due to reopen on Monday, but the reopening of indoor hospitality and entertainment in mid-May, as well as international travel, is dependent on the vaccine program continuing at pace.For those under 30, the immediately available alternative to Astra is the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which has been in circulation since December. The UK began the rollout of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine on Wednesday.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which only requires one shot rather than two like the others, could become available “over the summer,” Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said at the briefing.

              " ' Noida authority allows pets in city parks  Noida: Acting on a direction from the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), the Noida authority’s horticulture department has allowed entry of pets in city parks.“We have started removing the line that says ‘pets are prohibited inside’ from the boards installed in city parks. Soon this line will be removed in all city parks, mostly in this month,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty of the Noida authority heading horticulture department.The warning boards have been revised in several parks in sectors 1 to 12, 14, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 50, 51 and 53, and officials said changes will be made in the rest of the city “in another 20 days”. There are 726 parks under the authority across the city.Early February, a group of dog lovers had moved the AWBI and submitted photographs of the boards prohibiting entry of pets that the authority had put up. The issue was resulting in regular confrontations in residential blocks across the city, they argued.Acting on the petition, AWBI issued directions to the Noida authority in the last week of February to allow entry of pets in parks. Officials said the authority started removing the warning message from the parks from March 10. “After the horticulture department started removing this (banning entry of pets) line in their zones in parks, some people wanted to know if the authority bans the entry of pets in parks and we informed them that we do not prohibit the entry,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.While pet lovers have welcomed the move, it has, however, not gone down well with a few.Pet lover Sanjay Mahapatra, who runs a free animal clinic in sector 54 footpath, is among those who are overjoyed by the decision. “Stray animals, be it dogs, cats, birds and other animals, are part of our ecosystem and we, as human beings, need to take care of these animals. In cities, other than parks, there are no other open areas. We need to make feeding points for not only dogs but also for birds, who depend on us for food,” he said.However, colonel (retd) MS Saxena, who is the former president of sector 30 residents’ welfare association, said, “The Noida authority should first make adequate arrangements where dogs can answer nature’s call. The dog owners do not clean up the excreta of their dogs, thus creating sanitation issues in local parks. The authority must impose some fine for such dog owners.”Meanwhile, Noida officials clarified that pet owners will soon issue guidelines, which will include specific timings for pets in parks, for pet owners. Security guards will also be deputed at large parks to make sure only pets with leashes are allowed inside and that the owners are carrying scoops and poop bags. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Commuters of Crossings Republik, Greater Noida face issues as DME underpasses still not operational  To many who wish to travel to Crossings Republik township in Ghaziabad or Greater Noida (West), the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) is still out of bounds as the authorities are yet to open an underpass near ABES Engineering College.The national highways authority of India (NHAI), which constructed the DME, had left a median incomplete there, which commuters use to cross the road into incoming traffic and access the Shahberi road (also known as main Crossings Republik road) that leads to Crossings Republik and highrises in Greater Noida (West). The broken median is also an access for those who wish to move from these areas to the DME and onwards to Dasna and Meerut.The setup is risky with fast moving traffic from both sides, leaving sudden brakes difficult to execute. The upper speed limit on the DME in Uttar Pradesh is 100 kmph. “It is a big risk that commuters have to take but that has been the situation for months now. The underpasses that could have avoided this have not be opened up even though the DME was opened officially on April 1,” said Namita Gaur, resident of Crossings Republik. An alternative route that the more cautious commuter takes is Vijay Nagar to Greater Noida link road (to and fro) which is near Pratap Vihar. This involves an estimated additional travel of 3-4 kms in order to reach Greater Noida (West).The area near the ABES College is also major traffic junction for commuters. Just 500 metres away is the under construction railway over bridge (ROB) at Chipiyana. At the point, a 14-lane DME is suddenly bottlenecked into the current four-lane ROB.“In the absence of the underpasses, commuting has become risky on DME due to high flow of traffic and poses serious risk of accidents. There is no signage indicating the diversion towards Crossings Republik Township. Residents of Greater Noida (West) also move through the median of DME and take the Shahberi Road to go to their destination,” said Tarun Bharat Chauhan, president of Crossings Republik Owners & Members Association. The junction and the ROB are part of the DME’s phase 2 which is about 19.2km linking UP Gate and Dasna. It is estimated that around 60,000 passenger car units (PCU, a parameter that is determined by taking into account different vehicle types that ply on the road) per day. “The junction area is also poorly lit at night,” said Chauhan. “At the junction, there is major issue of wrong side driving as commuters have no alternative. When commuters further go to the ROB, there are traffic snarls due to pending construction and it sometimes results in long traffic jams up to the junction,” said Namita Gaur. NHAI officials said they had opened the median as a temporary measure for commuters. “The underpasses will be made operational soon and others works will also be taken up as required. Proper lighting and signage will also be put in place,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. “Six more lanes of the ROB will be complete by June and the rest by December-end,” Garg added.

              " ' NHAI opens interchange linking Delhi Meerut Expressway to Eastern Peripheral Express  With number of commuters growing since the four-phase Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) opened fully for traffic on April 1, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has now connected it with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) through an interchange.The interchange is located about 3kms away from Dasna at Rasoolpur Sikrod. “Commuters can now travel easily to Baghpat or to Gautam Budh Nagar via the EPE. They will be charged a toll through the reading of their FASTag (an electronic toll collection system) at the entry and exit points of the EPE,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI. According to official figures, the DME, which links Delhi to Meerut under 60 kms, has recorded one-side traffic of about 30,000 passenger car units (PCU, which is a unit to measure traffic depending on the type of vehicle) daily. So far, the interchange was blocked as the tolling for DME is yet to take off pending approval of the rates by the Union ministry of road transport and highways. Different operators manage the tolling systems for DME and EPE. “Once tolling starts at DME, the toll calculation will be between entry and exit points. In case a commuter uses the interchange, the toll will be so calculated as to pay the toll operator depending on the toll rates of each expressway,” Garg said.In February, the central government had mandated every vehicle to carry a FASTag. If any commuter opted to pay via cash, they would be charged double the toll rate for the entire DME stretch, said Garg. Officials said that the toll for DME is expected to be in range of ₹1.55 to ₹2.15 per kilometre. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for cooperation in healthcare in July 2018, both sides have held talks to identify suitable areas for collaboration such as health services, medical and clinical research, social health insurance, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. As a follow-up to a MoU on space cooperation signed in March 2019 and a statement of intent for space cooperation signed in August 2019, both sides have held discussions for collaboration between the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) and Bahrain’s National Space Science Agency, including building and launching a nano-satellite, establishing a ground station and providing assistance in capacity building to Bahrain. The Indian side thanked the government of Bahrain for the safety, security and welfare of the Indian community, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. It expressed its appreciation to the Bahraini side for facilitating repatriation flights and for providing free Covid-19 vaccination to all, including the Indian community. The Bahraini side appreciated India’s role in keeping open supply chains for essential items, including food and medicines, amid the pandemic, and in gifting 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Bahrain is home to some 3,50,000 Indians, the largest expatriate community, and New Delhi had facilitated the travel of Indian medical professionals to Manama last year to cope with the pandemic.

              " ' Out on bail, Anil Dujana booked for criminal intimidation  Gangster Anil Dujana was on Wednesday booked for allegedly threatening a complainant in a murder case against him in Greater Noida.Accused in 43 criminal cases, Dujana was arrested in 2012 in connection with a murder in Muzaffarnagar. In February, he was released on bail.Dinesh Kumar, station house officer of Badalpur police station, said, “In 2011 he had allegedly murdered a trader named Jay Chand. That murder case was regsitered at Dadri police station and Chand’s wife Sangeeta Tomar (40) is pursuing the legal battle. On April 4, Dujana waylaid Tomar and told her to turn hostile in the case or there would be consequences.”But Tomar did not back down. She lodged a complaint with the Badalpur police.“Based on the complaint, a case under section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against Dujana. Though he is on bail, he is not at his Greater Noida home,” the SHO said. He added that Tomar had been given security since her husband’s murder.Dujana’s criminal cases include murder, attempt to murder, extortion, criminal intimidation, among others. After bail, he had married a woman named Pooja, a resident of Baraut in Baghpat. Jitendra Nagar, Dujana’s advocate, said that the cases against his client are false. “There are only 15-16 active cases against Dujana now. Pooja wanted to contest the Zila Panchayat election from Ward No 2. She had bought the form and was making preparations. We got to know about recent FIR against Dujana. This is a fictitious allegation as Dujana is not in Greater Noida,” he said. Nagar said that the case appears to be rival’s ruse to stop Pooja from contesting. “We suspect if Pooja contests, Dujana will be arrested to prevent him from campaigning for her. Pooja has decided against contesting the election now,” Nagar said. Pooja’s political banners and posters were also removed on Wednesday. Dujana and his wife were not available for a comment. Dujana had won the Zila panchayat election while contesting from the jail in 2016. He had defeated Sangram Singh, who carried out his election campaign wearing a bulletproof jacket, by 10030 votes.DCP (Noida Central) Harish Chander said that since Dujan had violated the terms of his bail, he’d be arrested. “We would also appeal to the high court against bail.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' UP govt allows increase in floor area ratio for plots in Greater Noida: Officials  GREATER NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday allowed amendment of the Greater Noida Industrial Area (Fifth Amendment) Building Regulations, 2021. The revised rules and regulations for the construction of buildings will help certain categories of allottees to construct more areas over a plot, and build taller towers in some categories of plots, according to the officials.The amendment came after the Town and Planning Department in Greater Noida sent a proposal to the Uttar Pradesh government, that finally issued a gazette notification, allowing an increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) — which is the proportion obtained by dividing the total covered area (plinth area) on all floors by the area of the plot. Information technology and other such companies will be able to construct double the number of floors than what has been allowed so far, since the FAR allowed for such housing complexes was increased from 1 to 2.The non-polluting industrial units, including biotechnology, research and development companies, will be allowed to construct 4.25 times of space over the size of the plots. While the FAR for 2 will be given to them at the time of the allotment, an additional 2.25 FAR can be bought by paying the required premium. The FAR for new residential group housing, commercial and mixed-use projects will remain the same, capped at 5.25.SP Shukla, Officer on special duty (industries), said that the planning department had assessed the demand of the allottees, and requested the government to revise the rules.“With the FAR for 1, an allottee having a plot of 5,000-square-metre can construct floors having a cumulative area of 5,000-square-metre. With the FAR of 2, an individual can construct 10,000-square-metre of floor space over the same plot. The FAR is increased or decreased to make investments in a town more lucrative than the neighbouring cities, or to bring down congestion levels,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO), Greater Noida authority.

              " ' Ghaziabad scales up Covid beds to about 1,500 as cases rise  Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad administration has scaled up the number of beds in private and government hospitals to deal with an upsurge in Covid-19 cases in the district. Officials said that a total of 1,486 Covid-19 beds have been made available -- 968 in private hospitals and 518 in government facilities. “We have scaled up the beds in the district, and more would be arranged as and when required. At present, we have more than three times more beds available in comparison to the active cases. Of the 1,486 beds, we have 118 beds having ventilators and 223 ICU beds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. According to the state’s daily Covid-19 bulletin, the district had 442 active cases till Wednesday morning. Out of 442 patients, 212 of them are in home isolation and 55 admitted to government hospitals while the rest taking up treatment in private hospitals, the officials said. At the end of March when the district had 309 active cases, about 400 beds were available for Covid-19 patients in the government hospitals, they said.“The severity of infection is almost similar to what prevailed during the last year. Majority of the patients at present are asymptomatic and about 48% patients are in home isolation,” Gupta added. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls. Of the 518 Covid beds under the district administration, 400 are at Santosh Medical College which is an L3 category facility (for moderate patients), while 118 are at Sanjay Nagar government hospital which is an L2 category facility (for critical patients). “We have 10 patients in our hospital and they have mild to moderate symptoms. We have put only one of them on oxygen as a precautionary measure,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar hospital. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad on Wednesday reported 76 fresh cases, taking the total number of positive cases in the district to 27,712, which included 102 deaths. So far, a total of 27,165 patients have been discharged in the district, as per the health bulletin.Experts said that the present wave of infection is more contagious than the last year’s. “The infection is spreading fast. The spread is more as there is no check on movement of people and many are still not following precautions like social distancing or wearing of face mask,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “The good thing is that we have just about 5% cases which have gone to severe condition,” said Jindal. To gauge the spread of infection in the district, the sample positivity rate in Ghaziabad during the month of March stood at 0.69% while it is now about 1.36% during first five days of April. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than total positive cases, the officials explained. The state officials said that UP has 31,987 active cases, besides 8,964 deaths and 604,979 patients discharged till April 7. “Of the total active cases, we have 18,679 patients who are in home isolation and 668 in private hospitals while the rest are taking up treatment in government health-care facilities,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).

              " ' Noida: Night curfew, cap on guests plague weddings  The night curfew imposed in Delhi on Tuesday, coupled with the Uttar Pradesh government’s guidelines capping the number of guests attending weddings in the state, has come as a blow to Noida. People are either cancelling their booking in banquets and halls for wedding functions, or worrying over which guest to invite and whom to leave out.Banquet operators said they have been getting calls from their clients to cancel and refund their bookings.“Three weddings planned in our hall were such where the bride’s side is from Noida but the groom’s side was supposed to come from Delhi. It is nearly impossible for the baraat (wedding procession) to arrive in Noida before 10pm. Many guests have to go back home to Delhi. Because of such issues, two of our bookings have been cancelled,” said the manager of a wedding hall in sector-16’s World Trade Tower.Pavan Verma, a resident of Green Arch apartments in Noida Extension, has postponed the engagement ceremony of his daughter that was scheduled to take place on April 25.“As soon as I heard the new guidelines on Monday, I decided to cancel the booking for the ceremony. Thankfully, the banquet hall owner has agreed to refund the token amount paid after a deducting 10%,” said Verma, who had booked a banquet in Greater Noida.Another banquet hall owner said the restrictions are hurting those who have bigger halls.“Big banquet halls are operated in a way such that it can accommodate up to 300-400 guests. With the restrictions in place, we will have to increase our prices if only 100 people are allowed because the fixed prices will be same, be it for a gathering of 300 people or 100. Because of this, clients have cancelled bookings with us and moved to smaller banquets where prices are lower,” said Shashank Gupta, who runs Rajdhani party hall in sector-104, adding that smaller banquets will charge much less for a gathering of 100 people.“Moreover, we have to give in to clients’ requests for refund on booking amount and return the money,” said Gupta.Making arrangements for stay of Delhi guests With just a fortnight to go for a host of functions lined up for majority of weddings, most residents in Noida who had functions planned are now finding it embarrassing to ask some of their guest to not come for the ceremony.“The wedding invites have already been sent. Earlier, we had decided the groom’s side will have 100 guests and the bride’s side will have another 100. However, now we have decided to have 50 guests each from both sides and brainstorming on whom to say sorry to and whom to invite,” said M C Singhal, whose son’s wedding has been planned at a banquet hall in sector 62.He added the banquet hall owner offered him a solution. “The banquet hall owner said since there is a cap on the number of guests in one hall, he will make a booking for another hall in my name so that I can invite all 200 guests. However, I refused as I do not want to violate any guidelines,” he said.Those who have guests coming in from Delhi are also in a fix. “We have a ring ceremony planned for April 24 and the wedding is scheduled for the next day. Since a night curfew has been imposed in Delhi, I doubt if our guests will be able to leave the ring ceremony on April 24 before 10pm. In such short notice, I have little option but to arrange for their overnight stay in Noida itself,” said Mina Chaturvedi, whose daughter’s wedding will be held at a banquet hall in sector 71.Some people are making changes in timing of their functions so that guests coming from Delhi can leave on time. “We have a mehendi function in sector-104 that was earlier supposed to start at 7pm. Now, we have preponed the timing to 5pm so that guests coming from Delhi can leave before 10pm,” said Prakhar Mohan Mathur, a resident of Sector 75. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' Joe Biden administration makes pitch for higher business taxes  The Biden administration is drilling down on the argument that higher corporate tax rates would ultimately help an ailing economy, saying the resulting infrastructure investments would boost growth.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday it was “self-defeating” for then-President Donald Trump to assume that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% in 2017 would make the economy more competitive and unleash growth. Yellen said that competing on tax rates came at the expense of investing in workers.“Tax reform is not a zero-sum game,” she told reporters on a call. “Win-win is an overused phrase, but we have a real win in front of us now.”President Joe Biden last week proposed a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan that would largely be funded by an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28% and an expanded global minimum tax set at 21%. Yellen said the plan would double-down on investing in workers\\' skills and traditional infrastructure such as roads and bridges as well as modern infrastructure such as broadband. The increases would produce roughly $2.5 trillion in revenues over 15 years, enough to cover the eight years\\' worth of infrastructure investments being proposed.The roughly $200 billion gap between how much the taxes would raise and how much the administration wants to spend suggests there is space to address critics, such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote, who would prefer a 25% rate. Republican lawmakers have opposed the plan because of its tax hikes and what they say is an overly broad definition of infrastructure.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Wednesday that businesses and lawmakers should come to the bargaining table, noting that there could be room to negotiate on the rate and timeline.“There is room for compromise,” Raimondo said at the White House briefing. “What we cannot do, and what I am imploring the business community not to do, is to say, ‘We don’t like 28. We\\'re walking away. We\\'re not discussing.\\'\"Key to the Biden administration\\'s pitch is bringing corporate tax revenues closer to their historic levels, rather than hiking them to new highs that could make US businesses less competitive globally.Trump\\'s 2017 tax cuts halved corporate tax revenues to 1% of gross domestic product, which is a measure of the total income in the economy. Revenues had previously equaled 2% of GDP. That higher figure is still below the 3% average of peer nations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Treasury Department said in its summary of the plan.Still, some say the administration\\'s claim is misleading.“The administration should use statistics that directly measure the burden on the corporate sector,” said Kyle Pomerleau, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “In fact, many measures of effective tax rates show that the US’s burden is pretty close to middle of the road. Biden’s plan would certain push up to the high end among our major trading partners.”Yellen also said the 2017 tax cuts failed to deliver on Trump\\'s promise of an accelerating economy. Instead, the cuts encouraged other countries to keep reducing their own tax rates in a “race-to-the-bottom” that the Biden plan believes can be halted with an enhanced minimum tax and agreements with other nations.The infrastructure investments would increase the level of GDP in 2024 by 1.6%, according to estimates by Moody\\'s Analytics.But the proposal has also drawn criticism from business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, which argue that higher taxes would hurt US companies operating worldwide and the wider economy.The Penn-Wharton Budget Model issued a report Wednesday saying the combined spending and taxes would cause government debt to rise by 2031 and then decrease by 2050. But following the plan, GDP would be lower by 0.8% in 2050. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics united states ',\n",

              " ' Madhubani killings: RJD, Congress raise the heat  Stepping up attack on the Nitish Kumar government over the recent killing of five persons, including an assistant sub-inspector of the Border Security Force (BSF), at a village in Madhubani district, the Opposition on Wednesday accused the state administration of giving patronage to the accused and demanded a fair probe.Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who visited the victim’s family at Mahmudpur village, sought a probe into the alleged links between BJP MLA from Benipatti Binod Narayan Jha and the main accused in the case, Pravin Jha , who allegedly runs a private army called Ravan Sena and was arrested from Nepal on Wednesday.Addressing a press conference, Yadav said, “Neither chief minister Nitish Kumar nor the deputy chief ministers visited the village. It was only after I visited the site of incident and talked with the family of the deceased that the main accused was arrested. It shows the government only acted when there was pressure from the opposition.”He also alleged that the police and state administration were giving patronage to “Ravan Sena” chief all these days after the incident took place on March 29 because of Jha’s political links. “I was told by family members of the deceased and locals about BJP MLA Binod Narayan Jha’s close links with the Sena chief. We want police to seek call details of the BJP MLA and probe his alleged links with the main accused,” Yadav said.The RJD scion also demanded immediate removal of the district’s superintendent of police (SP) and the deputy SP, saying the kingpin enjoyed close proximity to them.The BJP MLA has dismissed the charge. “Criminals have no caste. I have never had links with such people and can never dream of keeping any such association. I want those involved in the killings to get death punishment,” Jha said.Meanwhile, a six-member fact-finding team of the state Congress, led by former minister Awadhesh Kumar Singh, said the bloodshed could have been averted had the district authorities responded swiftly and reached the spot on time. “The incident happened barely three kilometres from the subdivisional office of Benipatti, but the police took four hours to reach there despite frantic calls made by the villagers,” Singh said.The Madhubani massacre has snowballed into a major issue in the state and even the constituents of the ruling alliance had questioned the role of police.Forest and environment department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh alias Bablu, who visited the village a week after the incident, said, “This is not an ordinary crime. Yet, no action against the police officials was taken.”A delegation of JD(U) leaders led by former minister Jai Kumar Singh also met the victim’s family and later briefed the CM about the incident.On Tuesday, the CM has said no one involved in the killings would be spared.On the day of Holi on March 29, around 35 armed men had opened fire on the family of one Ranvijay Singh over a land dispute in the village.Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members, BSF officer Rana Pratap Singh, Amrendra Singh and Rudra narayan Singh, succumbed to his injuries a day later.Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently being treated at the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.The police said that about a dozen persons, including the main accused in the case Navin Jha, have been arrested so far.

Yadav said that as per the MCG’s street vending policy, original licensees of the carts cannot lease or transfer the ownership to another person.Around 1,600 street vendors are operating in MCG’s 125 street vending zones. The MCG’s first street vending zone opened in November 2016, on a vacant plot opposite Medanta Hospital in Sector 32. An MCG street vending zones is a designated area where street vendors, mainly food or beverage vendors, sell their products to residents at affordable rates.“As per the rule, a street cart can neither be transferred in the name of another nor can it be given to any other person on rent. During the survey and investigation, it has been found that some people have rented the cart to others or have been transferred in the name of others. This type of process is illegal, and the violators have been directed to surrender their cart or else legal action will be initiated by the MCG against them and their belongings confiscated,” said Yadav.Yadav said that street vendors in Sector 56, which had the highest number of violations, 75, were also called to his office on Monday for a meeting and were given until Wednesday evening to hand over their carts.“We are taking action against all street vending zones in a phased manner.

              " ' Two-storey building, adjoining shop gutted in fire at Sadar Bazar  A three-storey building and an adjoining shop were gutted in a major fire at Sadar Bazar on Wednesday evening as firefighting operations continued beyond 11pm, at the time of filing of the report. However, no injuries were reported in the incident.According to fire department officials, they received a call about the fire at 6.43pm and more than 20 fire tenders deployed to contain the fire. The cause of the fire was yet to be determined, said officials.The fire broke out in a three-floor hardware store, located at the point where the Basai Road starts. Initially, one fire tender was sent. However, upon arrival, fire department officials called for more vehicles due to the intensity of the blaze. “The entire three-floor hardware store is gutted. The fire broke out when shopkeepers and staff were present inside. However, they all managed to escape unharmed. We are yet to ascertain the cause of the fire. It is likely to have been caused by a short circuit,” said a fire department official at the spot.The official cited above also said that the hardware store had highly flammable objects, due to which the intensity of the fire continued to increase and spread to a one-storey plywood store located to the left side of the building. Officials said that the hardware store and plywood store shared boundaries.Fire department officials said they broke the shutters to start dousing operations. In the interim, they also used a 42-metre hydraulic ladder to douse the fire on the third floor of the hardware store, as the intensity of the fire was the highest there and they wanted to prevent it from spreading to other shops in the vicinity.As roads leading to the spot were narrow, traffic from Rajiv Chowk moving towards Sohna Chowk was also diverted.Officials turned off the power at the site as a section of overhead electric cables was also located in close proximity to the hardware store.With more than 1,200 shops and 350 street vendors, Sadar Bazar receives a high footfall in the evening hours. The fire department and Gurugram police officials cordoned off the site due to a high number of onlookers and also directed shopkeepers and other customers to move their vehicles to a safe distance.“Around 20-25 fire tenders are dousing the blaze. We are expecting to control it around midnight. No person has suffered any injuries in the incident. The fire has gutted two shops and dousing operations are underway to prevent it from spreading to other nearby shops,” said Sunil Adlakha, fire safety officer. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Don\\'t treat farmers\\' stir like Shaheen Bagh protest, Tikait tells government  BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Wednesday said the government should not treat the ongoing farmers\\' agitation like last year\\'s protest in Delhi\\'s Shaheen Bagh and asserted that the protesters will only go home after the new agricultural laws are repealed.He said the protesting farmers will follow all Covid-19 protocols and if need be, continue their agitation till 2023.Shaheen Bagh had emerged as the epicentre of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests last year as hundreds took part in a months-long sit-in that began in December 2019. The Delhi Police cleared the protest site on March 24, 2020, a day before a nationwide lockdown was enforced in view of the coronavirus outbreak.Speaking to reporters here, Tikait said the Centre\\'s farm laws will only spell losses for farmers.\"Farmers will not go back home till these laws are repealed. They talk of coronavirus but we have told the government that they should not treat this stir like Shaheen Bagh. This agitation will not end. We will follow the coronavirus guidelines and this agitation will continue till our demands are met,\" he said.In response to a question, he said, \"Even if we have to continue the protest till 2023, we are prepared. Till the time these laws are not repealed and a law is not framed on MSP, farmers will not go back home.\"Tikait reiterated that the farmers are ready to talk to the government.\"Whenever the government has time, we are ready to talk. We will wait for their call,\" he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three border points of Delhi -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- demanding a repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.

              " ' RWAs find it tough to track residents’ travel history  Even as the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city started enforcing the Covid-19 protocols in their societies and condominiums, following directions from the district administration on Tuesday, many said they were unable to ascertain the travel history of residents.“We received the circular on Wednesday and the directions related to wearing masks, thermal checking, sanitizing common areas is being taken up. It will be difficult to track flight plans as people cite privacy concerns and also don’t want to give too much information to RWAs,” said Sanjay Lal, former vice-president, Lagoon RWA.However, RWAs said they have started implementing safety measures with ease.At Ramprastha City, where around 1,200 families live in three condominiums, the RWA on Wednesday decided to restrict the entry of car cleaners and domestic helps who were working in houses from where new cases were reported. They have been asked to self-quarantine, said RWA members, adding that strict checking of visitors and thermal scanning of food delivery persons was also started.“Apart from taking these measures, we are organising a Covid test camp for all maintenance staff that includes horticulture, housekeeping technical workers,” said Pradeep Rahi, president, Ramprastha City Welfare Association, adding that from Thursday, they will start penalising residents who don’t wear masks.The administration on Tuesday put the onus of tracking travellers on RWAs, even as the city continued to witness a spike in Covid-19 cases, with 611, the highest single-day spike this year, reported on Wednesday. The number of active cases, which was at 534 on March 15, rose to 3,905 on Wednesday. The district administration said that the Covid-19 norms should be implemented strictly and violators will be charged under sections of the IPC and Disaster Management Act.At Vatika Seven Lamps in Vatika City, the RWA said it has shared guidelines issued by the district administration with residents and asked them to follow them strictly.“We are regularly sharing information, such as notices from administration, testing and vaccination with residents related. We are working towards limiting the entry of visitors and asked residents to declare their recent foreign travel history,” said Mamta Yadav, president, The Seven Lamps RWA.Yadav, however, said that getting travel details and other personal information was difficult for RWAs, as residents fear they would be forced into quarantine.RWA functionaries said that some residents even avoid testing, as a positive result could bring their work and travel plans to a halt. “People prefer staying at home and getting treated silently as Covid-19 is still considered a stigma,” said an RWA member, requesting anonymity.On Sohna road, Dharmender Jha, the president of Rosewood RWA, said all curbs will.be implemented fully in two to three days. “If home deliveries are banned, people start fighting with the RWA. So instead of banning these, we have decided to enforce thermal checks and sanitization of visitors. We are also strict on wearing masks for everyone and challans will be issued to violators,” he said.Parveen Malik, a resident of Sare Homes, said that their RWA had already put in place several measures but these are being made more stringent. “People not wearing masks will be fined, we already have a database of senior citizens, who will be cared for. Entry of outsiders will be restricted,” he said.Agencies maintaining condominiums also said that they had activated the safety protocols and are working towards implementing the norms. “We are closely following the rising Covid cases in the country, specifically across Delhi/ NCR. We have been sending out communication in the form of mailers and WhatsApp to residents, so that they adhere to Covid-19 safety guidelines,” said AK Singh, president and chief executive officer of Enviro, a maintenance agency.

              " ' GMDA to repair, de-silt drains to prevent road cave-ins  In a bid to prevent road cave-ins during monsoon, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) proposed a project to repair sewer lines across the city and de-silt them, officials said on Wednesday. A proposal for the project, along with rehabilitation and strengthening of old master sewer lines, is likely to be tabled before the chief minister for approval during the authority’s board meeting scheduled on Friday.“During monsoon, overflow from drains and sewer lines is reported from many areas and to curb that, we have made this proposal with the idea of Gurugram heading towards a silt-free area. This will be a round-the-clock project with special focus on areas where all kinds of waste are dumped in the sewer lines, leading to heavy silting and blockage,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer for infrastructure-II division of GMDA.Kumar said that such areas are being identified and work will start after approval. However, no timeline has been set for the completion of the work.According to GMDA officials, instances of heavy waste in sewer lines have been often reported from Iffco Chowk and stretches along the Mehrauli-Gurugram Road in the past few years. With roads built over the sewer lines, there is a potential danger of accidents, if the sewer line breaks due to pressure, he said.The city has a 135-kilometre-long sewer network, for which de-silting will be done in phases. The authority has already carried out de-silting (as part of other projects currently underway) for 33 kilometres and an estimate for de-silting 53 kilometres has been made. De-silting will not be needed for 25 kilometres of the network as the sewer lines are comparatively new, said officials.The project is estimated to cost around ₹130 crore.Kumar said, “Due to production of gases like methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphite and others, the internal surface of the pipelines that have been there for over 25-30 years starts decaying. Over time, stretches where heavy waste (like industrial waste) is dumped in sewer lines become more prone to damage and for that, we have planned to repair some particular stretches.”The authority has also kept a provision for cured in place pipe (CIPP) for repairing sewer lines on a 15-kilometre stretch. Such repair work has already been done over 9 kilometres in the last year. Through CIPP, specific stretches of the sewer network where heavy damage has been caused, due to accumulation of silt along with the production of toxic gases from waste dumped in the sewer lines, are repaired. This process is followed to avoid changing the whole sewer line, which can cause inconvenience to the public.In May last year, the GMDA found around 48 points in the city where sewer lines from the neighbouring residential and commercial establishments were connected to the surface drains illegally. Such illegal connections add to the burden of the pipelines, resulting in faster decay and damage. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Speeding car rams motorbike, kills two  Two persons died after the motorcycle they were riding was hit by a speeding car ahead of an under-construction toll plaza on Sohna Road on Tuesday night. The police said that the car driver allegedly fled the scene leaving the vehicle behind. He has been identified but was yet to be arrested. The police said the accident took place around 10.15pm. According to the police, the victims, identified as Majlis Habib and Mohammad Salamuddin of Dhunela in Bhondsi, worked as motor mechanics in a private workshop in Shivaji Nagar in Sector in 11. Jagbir Singh, station house officer of Bhondsi police station, said that it was a head-on collision and due to the high speed of the car, victims were flung to the other side of the road, around 50 metres from the spot of the collision, due to the impact. “The car driver was speeding and driving rashly. Due to the toll plaza construction, the route is one way. The driver lost control and rammed the motorbike from the front. Both men fell on the road and sustained critical injuries to their heads and bodies. The car driver must have also suffered injuries due to the heavy impact,” he said. The police said that the motorbike and the front side of the car were completely damaged due to the impact.After passersby informed the police, a team from Bhondsi police station took the injured persons to Sohna Civil hospital, but doctors declared them brought dead. Rashid Khan, a cousin of Habib, said he was riding on his motorcycle a few metres away when the accident took place. “Every day after work I along with Habib and another mechanic used to ride back together to our village. On Tuesday, after closing my workshop in Sector 15, I called them and we met at Subhash Chowk. They were around 50 metres ahead of me when they met with an accident,” he said. Police said they were checking the CCTV footage from different locations on the stretch to establish the speed of the car. A case was registered against the suspect under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304A (death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Bhondsi police station on Tuesday.

This hike in rates will further demotivate the buyers in Gurugram and Haryana, as the taxes are already high here.

Investigators, however, did search the SUV’s data recorder, known as a black box, in the days after the crash.Woods is in Florida recovering from multiple surgeries.Originally from the Los Angeles area, Woods had been back home in February to host his PGA tournament, the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club.He was driving an SUV loaned to him by the tournament when he struck a raised median. The SUV crossed through two oncoming lanes and uprooted a tree.Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva previously said detectives had determined the cause of the crash, but he would not release it, citing privacy concerns and a purported need for Woods' permission to divulge information.The sheriff planned to discuss the findings of the investigation, including “causal factors,” during a news conference Wednesday morning in Los Angeles, the sheriff's department said in a statement.It was not immediately clear whether Woods had any involvement in the expected announcement.

They (petitioners) wanted that no Rohingya be deported, we had said that we will follow the law. They are illegal immigrants. We are always in touch with Myanmar and when they confirm that the individual is their citizen, then only deportation can take place,” the Centre had said.Bhushan had alleged that Jammu and Kashmir administration has detained Rohingyas in Jammu, who have refugee cards and they will soon be deported.On March 11, an interim plea was filed in a pending PIL seeking immediate release of detained Rohingya refugees in Jammu.The plea also sought direction to Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) for Rohingyas in informal camps.The application, filed by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee, has said that it is filed in public interest in order to secure and protect the right against deportation of refugees in India.The plea said that it is filed to protect rights guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 21, read with Article 51(c) of the Constitution, against the deportation of Rohingya refugees who have taken refuge in India after escaping widespread violence and discrimination against their community in Myanmar.“Release the detained Rohingya refugees immediately and direct the Union Territory government and the Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant Refugee identification cards through the FRRO for Rohingyas in informal camps,” it said.It sought direction to the Union Government to refrain from implementing any orders on deporting Rohingya refugees, who have been detained in the sub jail in Jammu.Violent attacks allegedly by Myanmar army have led to an exodus of Rohingya tribals from the western Rakhine state in that country to India and Bangladesh.Many of them, who had fled to India after the earlier spate of violence, have settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan.

              " ' Backlash after Pakistan PM Imran Khan links rape to how women dress  Pakistan rights campaigners have accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of \"baffling ignorance\" after the former playboy cricketer blamed how women dress for a rise in rape cases.In a weekend interview on live television, Oxford-educated Khan said an increase in rapes indicated the \"consequences in any society where vulgarity is on the rise\".\"The incidents of rape of women... (have) actually very rapidly increased in society,\" he said.He advised women to cover up to prevent temptation.\"This entire concept of purdah is to avoid temptation, not everyone has the willpower to avoid it,\" he said, using a term that can refer to modest dress or the segregation of the sexes.Hundreds have signed a statement circulating online Wednesday calling Khan\\'s comments \"factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous\".\"Fault rests solely with the rapist and the system that enables the rapist, including a culture fostered by statements such as those made by (Khan),\" the statement said.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent rights watchdog, said Tuesday it was \"appalled\" by the comments.\"Not only does this betray a baffling ignorance of where, why and how rape occurs, but it also lays the blame on rape survivors, who, as the government must know, can range from young children to victims of honour crimes,\" it said.Pakistan is a deeply conservative country where victims of sexual abuse are often viewed with suspicion and criminal complaints are rarely seriously investigated.Much of the country lives under an \"honour\" code where women who bring \"shame\" on the family can be subjected to violence or murder.It regularly ranks among the worst places in the world for gender equality.Nationwide protests erupted last year when a police chief admonished a gang-rape victim for driving at night without a male companion.The Franco-Pakistani mother was assaulted in front of her children on the side of a motorway after her car ran out of fuel.Last year, Khan was also criticised after another television appearance where he failed to challenge a Muslim cleric\\'s insistence that coronavirus had been unleashed because of the wrongdoings of women.The latest controversy comes as the organisers behind International Women\\'s Day marches battle what they have called a coordinated disinformation campaign against them, including doctored images and videos circulated online.It has led to blasphemy accusations -- a hugely sensitive issue in Pakistan where allegations have previously led mobs to attack people.The organisers of the annual rally have called for the prime minister to intervene.In his weekend TV appearance, Khan also blamed divorce rates in Britain on the \"sex, drugs and rock and roll\" culture that began in the 1970s, when the twice-divorced Khan was gaining a reputation in London as a playboy.

              " ' Realtors welcome RBI policy, urge apex bank to boost liquidity in housing sector  The real estate industry on Wednesday hailed the RBI\\'s decision to keep the key policy rates unchanged and provide additional liquidity of ₹10,000 crore to the National Housing Bank (NHB) but said the apex bank should ensure that the fund is being made available to cash-starved developers to complete projects.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept key interest rates unchanged and stuck to its accommodative stance amid concerns of rising Covid-19 infections that could derail the nascent economic recovery.\"By keeping the repo rates unchanged, RBI has maintained an accommodative stance. The RBI Governor\\'s assurance to provide adequate credit by ensuring ample liquidity & announcement of ₹10,000 cr additional liquidity to NHB must be passed onto the real estate as the sector has been struggling to source funds for projects,\" CREDAI National President Harsh Vardhan Patodia said.Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, CBRE India, South- East Asia, Middle East and Africa, said the RBI decision has been undertaken with the aim of ensuring economic revival, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.The central bank has announced additional measures such as special liquidity facilities for financial institutions, including ₹10,000 crore for the NHB, he said, adding these measures would assist the revival of the real estate sector.NAREDCO President Niranjan Hiranandani said: \"The unchanged repo rate by the RBI which signals to keep the borrowing momentum buoyant. Also, pegging the real GDP forecast at 10.5 per cent reflects Indian economic recovery to be healthy, self-sustainable and resilient.\"Sanjay Dutt, MD and CEO, Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd, said this is the fifth time in a row that the RBI has tried to maintain an accommodative stance and it will certainly play an important role in the long-term recovery of the sector.\"Considering that real estate forms the backbone of several other sectors, we urge the government to introduce measures that truly uplift the sector, such as granting of industry status, allowing FDI in RTMI (ready-to-move-in) projects and extending the tax benefit from affordable to mid housing,\" he added.Ashish R Puravankara, managing director, Puravankara Ltd, said the unchanged repo rate will be integral in driving investments to the real estate sector and enable more home buyers to enter the market with ease.Manoj Gaur, CMD, Gaurs Group welcomed the RBI policy but felt more measures need to be taken to revive the sector.The real estate sector needs several measures, and we expect a push from RBI to the banks to disburse loans to the sector, said Uddhav Poddar, MD, Bhumika Group.Ram Raheja, director, S Raheja Realty, said this will continue to further foster the demand for housing. \"Housing markets have responded well in the past to lower home loan rates, stamp duty reduction and other rebates.\"Mumbai-based builder Spenta Corporation\\'s MD Farshid Cooper said a rate cut would have been beneficial for the consumers.Among property consultants, Housing.com and PropTiger CEO Dhruv Agarwala said the RBI\\'s decision is on expected lines. He hoped that lenders would take a cue from the RBI\\'s move to leave rates unchanged and continue to offer homebuyers the benefit of a historically low interest rate regime.Anuj Puri, Chairman, ANAROCK, said home loan rates may remain stable.However, he said: \"The incentive period for lower rates (starting from 6.7 per cent) expired on March 31. SBI has already reverted to their normal rates and other banks will also follow suit. This may have some impact on the housing demand, especially in Maharashtra where the stamp duty cuts coupled with lowest-ever home loan rates had significantly boosted housing demand.\"Savills India CEO Anurag Mathur said the RBI kept repo rate unchanged despite the marginal rise in inflation in recent months. \"The real estate market, especially the affordable housing segment, will continue to benefit from the record low interest rates.\"Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research & REIS, JLL India, said the resurgence of the pandemic and resultant concerns of its impact on economy and businesses demanded a resilient approach.Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist and National Director – Research, Knight Frank India, said: \"The RBI has taken reassuring steps to infuse additional liquidity into the housing sector through the interventions of increased financing to National Housing Bank and extension of priority sector tag for bank funding to NBFCs for housing loans.\"Honeyy Katiyal, founder of Investors Clinic, said it is an important step to enable the economic recovery to remain sustained.\"The RBI and especially the MPC needs to be commended for maintaining its accommodative stance for more than a year now.

              " ' Jharkhand to get 12 lakh vaccine doses in 2 days  Jharkhand heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday after the Union health ministry confirmed that it will send 12 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines by Thursday and Friday. The central government will send two lakh doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and 10 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine of Pune-based Serum Institute of India, state health department officials said.“The Government of India (GoI) will send two lakh doses of Covaxin vaccine by Thursday, while 10 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine is likely to reach Ranchi by Friday. With this, the state now has adequate doses of the two vaccines for second dose of vaccination,” Ravi Shankar Shukla, state mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), said.The state health department currently has 97,037 doses of Covishield and 20,124 doses of Covaxin at its disposal as on Wednesday evening, Shukla said.The state recently on April 3 requested the GoI for five lakh doses of the vaccines in wake of the drying stock.Besides, the ongoing vaccination drive across the state was also regulated due to the depleting stock of vaccines, particularly Covaxin. An order was issued a couple of days ago asking districts not to use Covaxin for first dose and use it only for the second dose. One of the worst-hit districts, East Singhbhum (Jamshedpur) was only left with 960 doses of the two vaccines, 430 doses of Covishield and 530 doses of Covaxin, by Tuesday night. This was after obtaining 3,500 doses of Covishield from West Singhbhum and 730 doses of Covaxin from Seraikela-Kharsawan districts. Jamshedpur alone requires 12-15,000 doses of the vaccines per day.The state till 6pm on Wednesday administered first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 1,827,886 beneficiaries and second dose to 278, 989 persons. The need of rapid and wide coverage of the vaccination drive has become an absolute necessity with the fast spreading infection and steep spike in the number of fresh cases across the state, especially Ranchi and Jamshedpur. During past 24 hours, the state detected 1,265 new Covid-19 cases, of which 539 were found in Ranchi alone. Jamshedpur, on the other hand, detected 340 new Covid-19 patients. The state reported 13 Covid-19 deaths during the past seven days, according to the health department’s bulletin. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' No V-C for four new Bihar varsities, under additional charge  All the three new state universities, carved out of existing bigger universities in 2018, have slipped under ad hoc arrangement after the term of their vice-chancellors fell vacant. The latest to join the list is Munger University.While the term of Munger University vice-chancellor (V-C) Ranjit Kumar Verma ended last month, Patalputra University V-C Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal quit in January a few months before his tenure’s end. Purnea University V-C Rajesh Singh had resigned in September last year for a new assignment in Uttar Pradesh. While, TM Bhagalpur University V-C Neelima Gupta is holding the additional charge of Munger University, Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) V-C SP Singh has the additional charge of Pataliputra University, as the term of Pro-V-C in both the universities has also ended. In Purnea University, however, Pro-V-C RS Yadav is the acting V-C. The vacancies at the top are likely to affect Bihar’s quest for certification of its colleges by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). NAAC has already set 2022 deadline for certification of all colleges in the country. Bihar has been slow on that count and even the best of state’s colleges that went in for certification have fumbled due to lack of teachers, facilities, intent and poor feedback from students. Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU), set up in 2010 to regulate all technical institutions by bringing them under one umbrella, has also been without a regular V-C since September 20, 2020, when the term of Arun Kumar Agarwal ended. Since then, AKU Pro-V-C Syed Mohammad Karim has been holding the additional charge of V-C, though he, too, is set to retire in a couple of months. The Raj Bhawan had invited applications afresh for the appointment of V-C at the AKU in January this year after cancelling the September 2020 advertisement “due to unavoidable reason”. The candidates who had applied earlier were asked to apply afresh, if interested. The last date ended on March 1. Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, is also without a V-C since the term of Ajoy Kumar Singh ended earlier this year. Director, extension, BAU, RK Sohana, is the acting V-C since then. Nalanda Open University (NOU) in Patna is also continuing under interim measure after the sudden resignation of HN Prasad in November last. Besides, Animal Science University, set up in 2017, does not have a Pro-V-C. The situation is similar in the Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga University (KSDSU). More vacancies are likely to occur in the months to come. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Madhubani killings: Caste militias in spotlight again  The Madhubani killings, in which five persons of a family in a village were shot dead on March 29 on the day of Holi, has once again turned the spotlight on the infamous militias in Bihar, mostly formed on caste lines.The main accused in this case, Pravin Jha (30), who calls himself Ravan for reasons not yet clear, was heading a private army which he named “Ravan Sena”, mainly consisting of Brahmins in the area.Police say the violence took place for fishing rights in a local pond, which is a source of income of many in the area. The dominant Rajput community of the village had control over the pond which Jha wanted for Brahmins. Private caste armies are nothing new to Bihar, the most notorious being Ranvir Sena (of Bhumihars). Others were Lorik Sena (Bhumihars) , Bhumi Sena (Bhumihars) and Kisan Sangh (Rajputs).Caste armies hit headlines mostly in 1990s when they executed massacres, mostly in central Bihar.The “Ravan Sena” of Benippati in Madhubani district was raised in 2018 and is the second of its kind militia group in the Brahmin community, with its influence mainly confined to Madhubani. “Of late, it has become active on social media in some pockets of Gopalganj as well,” said a police officer on the condition of anonymity.The first private army of Brahmins, called the “Parshuram Sena”, was formed by dreaded gangster Santosh Jha, who broke away from CPI (Maoist) in early 2000 and formed “People’s Liberation Army”, also known as “Parshuram Sena”, in Nepal. The outfit has been known to demand and collect extortion from contractors executing road projects. Its members allegedly killed over a dozen engineers and supervisors in the last one decade. Jha, who was serving a life term for the murder of two engineers and was facing trial in about 20 criminal cases, was shot dead on court premises in Sitamarhi on August 28, 2018. “The Parshuram Sena operates in Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Darbhanga and Madhubani districts of north Bihar, besides adjoining Nepal, and has a more wider reach that Ravan Sena,” said a police officer.According to his Facebook’s profile, Jha of Ravan Sena was preparing to contest panchayat election and had already declared himself as Mukhiya. Police sources in Darbhanga said he had been an active member of the Bajarang Dal and was a former president of its district unit. “Yes, I am villain for those who are dividing the society for vested interests, those who are promoting injustice,” one of the posts uploaded by him on his FB page says. A legislator of the ruling JD (U), who visited the village after the killings as a member of the party’s fact-finding team, described Jha as a “ruffian who indulged in extortion”. Madhubani’s superintendent Dr Satya Prakash said only two cases were lodged against Pravin of Ravan Sena in the district. “We are interrogating him for more details.” Rival political parties alleged he was also into illegal liquor business. However, police said no case had been lodged against him for liquor recovery. “Only a case for recovery of illegal arms had been lodged,” said a police official. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Madhubani killings: RJD, Cong raise the heat  Stepping up attack on the Nitish Kumar government over the recent killing of five persons, including an assistant sub-inspector of the Border Security Force (BSF), at a village in Madhubani district, the Opposition on Wednesday accused the state administration of giving patronage to the accused and demanded a fair probe.Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who visited the victim’s family at Mahmudpur village, sought a probe into the alleged links between BJP MLA from Benipatti Binod Narayan Jha and the main accused in the case, Pravin Jha , who allegedly runs a private army called Ravan Sena and was arrested from Nepal on Wednesday. Addressing a press conference, Yadav said, “Neither chief minister Nitish Kumar nor the deputy chief ministers visited the village. It was only after I visited the site of incident and talked with the family of the deceased that the main accused was arrested. It shows the government only acted when there was pressure from the opposition.” He also alleged that the police and state administration were giving patronage to “Ravan Sena” chief all these days after the incident took place on March 29 because of Jha’s political links. “I was told by family members of the deceased and locals about BJP MLA Binod Narayan Jha’s close links with the Sena chief. We want police to seek call details of the BJP MLA and probe his alleged links with the main accused,” Yadav said. The RJD scion also demanded immediate removal of the district’s superintendent of police (SP) and the deputy SP, saying the kingpin enjoyed close proximity to them.The BJP MLA has dismissed the charge. “Criminals have no caste. I have never had links with such people and can never dream of keeping any such association. I want those involved in the killings to get death punishment,” Jha said. Meanwhile, a six-member fact-finding team of the state Congress, led by former minister Awadhesh Kumar Singh, said the bloodshed could have been averted had the district authorities responded swiftly and reached the spot on time. “The incident happened barely three kilometres from the subdivisional office of Benipatti, but the police took four hours to reach there despite frantic calls made by the villagers,” Singh said. The Madhubani massacre has snowballed into a major issue in the state and even the constituents of the ruling alliance had questioned the role of police. Forest and environment department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh alias Bablu, who visited the village a week after the incident, said, “This is not an ordinary crime. Yet, no action against the police officials was taken.” A delegation of JD(U) leaders led by former minister Jai Kumar Singh also met the victim’s family and later briefed the CM about the incident. On Tuesday, the CM has said no one involved in the killings would be spared. On the day of Holi on March 29, around 35 armed men had opened fire on the family of one Ranvijay Singh over a land dispute in the village. Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members, BSF officer Rana Pratap Singh, Amrendra Singh and Rudra narayan Singh, succumbed to injuries a day later.Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently being treated at the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. The police said that about a dozen persons, including the main accused in the case Navin Jha, have been arrested so far. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Munger police firing: HC shifts Munger SP, 7 others, orders ₹10 lakh for slain boy’s father  The Patna high court on Wednesday ordered to shift eight police officers of Munger district, including its superintendent of police M S Dhillon, within three days and asked the state government to pay a sum of ₹10 lakh to the father of an 18-year-old boy who was killed allegedly in police firing during the immersion of Durga idol on October 26 last year. Arguing for Amarnath Poddar, father of the slain boy Anurag Kumar, Supreme Court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava told the court of Justice Rajiv Ranjan Prasad that two months had passed but nothing had been done so far to give justice to the family. The HC was hearing a criminal writ petition filed by Poddar seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a compensation of ₹5 crore.Observing there was no allegation that the petitioner’s son was involved in any act of violence, the HC directed the state government to pay ₹10 lakh to the petitioner within a month. It further said the additional director general of CID shall decide on the constitution of an SIT of senior officers above the rank of DSP to interrogate the police personnel who are likely to be investigated. “... in order to ensure free and fair investigation of the case, the state respondents shall ensure that all the eight members of the SIT, including Munger SP, be shifted to some other place for the present within three days. The court, however, makes it clear that the order to shift them elsewhere be not taken as any indictment of all those officers by this court and no adverse inference shall be drawn against them for this reason alone,” reads the order. The court said the CID shall submit its first report in a sealed cover before it within a period of four weeks Advocate Srivastava said the HC had earlier refused to grant an urgent hearing in this case, after which the victim’s father filed a petition in the Supreme Court, which asked the HC on January 25 to decide the case within two months. Poddar said there was some hope of getting justice for his deceased son. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Madhubani killings: Kingpin arrested, top cop rules out caste angle  The police on Wednesday arrested five persons, including the main accused, in connection with the sensational killing of five members of a family, including a BSF officer, at Mahmudpur village in Madhibani district on March 29.The main accused, Pravin Jha, runs a militia called Ravan Sena, mainly consisting of Brahmins.According to Jitendra Kumar, additional director general (ADG), police headquarters, a police team led by Madhubani’s superintendent Dr Satya Prakash raided at a house at Raghauni village on Madhubani-Darbhanga border falling under Bisfi police station and arrested four named accused, identified as Pravin Jha alias Ravan, Chandan Jha, Mukesh Safi, Bhola Singh, and the house owner who gave them shelter. On the day of Holi, more than 50 armed men opened fire at the family of one Ranvijay Singh, with whom they had a running dispute over fishing from a local pond. While Ranvijay Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh died on spot, three other family members, Rana Pratap Singh (assistant sub-inspector in BSF), Amrendra Singh (interstate cricketer) and Rudra Narayan Singh, succumbed to injuries a day later. Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently being treated at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.Members of the victim family have demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and threatened to commit suicide before the chief minister’s residence if all named accused are not arrested within four days.Preliminary investigation suggests that the pond is owned by one Sanjay Singh (brother of Ranvijay), but another group wanted to take it over. On November 20, two separate cases were lodged by Sanjay and Mukesh Safi (close associate of Pravin Jha) against each other and Sanjay is currently lodged in a jail. Ajitabh Kumar, inspector general of police (Darbhanga range), said the incident was a fallout of battle for supremacy between two groups, and not two castes. “A case has been lodged against 35 people, including 18 Brahmins and 13 Rajputs, and dozens of unidentified accused. So far, 14 named accused have been arrested and sent to jail while one of the prominent accused, Navin Jha, is still absconding. The administration has attached his property,” said a police officer.

              " \" Dozens missing, death toll climbs to 140 in Indonesia landslides  The death toll from mudslides in eastern Indonesia has risen to 140 with dozens still missing, officials said Wednesday, as rain continued to pound the region and hamper the search.East Flores district on Adonara island suffered the highest losses with 67 bodies recovered so far and six missing. Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills early on Sunday, catching people at sleep. Some were swept away by flash floods after overnight rains caused rivers to burst their banks.On nearby Lembata island, the downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja sent solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November to crash down on more than a dozen villages, killing at least 32 and leaving 35 unaccounted for, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.Hundreds of police, soldiers and residents dug through the debris with their bare hands, shovels and hoes searching for those buried. Relatives wailed Wednesday as they watched rescuers pull out a mud-caked body, place it on a bamboo stretcher and take it away for burial.“Please find my father and mother who are still buried ... whatever their condition,” Suzanna Tasoin cried to rescuers struggling to dig up tons of volcanic materials and rocks with farm tools at Waimatan village on Lembata island, “We want to bury them with the respect they deserve.”In all, landslides and flooding have killed at least 126 across several islands in Indonesia as well as 27 people in neighbouring East Timor. Thousands of homes have been damaged and thousands of people displaced by the weather, which is expected to continue until at least Friday as the storm moves south toward Australia.Rescue efforts were being hampered by the rains and the remoteness of the area, where roads and bridges were damaged in many places.Rescue personnel with excavators and tons of food and medicine were being deployed from Makassar city on Sulawesi island, but were hindered by bad weather and extremely high waves.Five helicopters were helping to reach isolated areas of the islands, National Disaster Mitigation Agency chief Doni Monardo told reporters late Wednesday.He said evacuees were in dire need of basic necessities such as blankets, mats, tents, baby food and medical services.The government provided tens of thousands of anti-coronavirus masks, and Monardo said authorities would set up health posts at refugee camps to test people for the virus.He said six navy ships, including a hospital ship, carrying more goods were expected to arrive on Friday to relieve overwhelmed hospitals and clinics in East Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia's poorest provinces.

South Africa did have to change more than half its team following a series-leveling win in the second game after five players left for the IPL and batsman Rassie van der Dussen was ruled out injured. But Pakistan was still clearly better over the course of the three games.Fakhar was again the most impressive after a magnificent 193 in a losing cause in the second one-dayer.He made 101 from 104 balls this time and shared a 112-run opening stand with Imam-ul-Haq (57). Babar's classy 94 continued Pakistan's top-order flourish and the tourists were 206-1 at one point and set for a big total.Hasan Ali hammered it home with 32 not out from 11 balls right at the end, which included four sixes.Opener Janneman Malan's 70 threatened to give South Africa a chance, as did a 108-run stand in the middle order between Kyle Verreynne (62) and Andile Phehlukwayo (54).Pakistan removed those two in successive overs and Afridi cleaned up.

              " ' Right time to get a women\\'s league to build strong women\\'s team: Mandhana  Star India batter Smriti Mandhana feels a women\\'s cricket league will definitely help in building a potent squad as the Indian Premier League (IPL) has done it for the men\\'s team over the years.India women currently participate in the Women\\'s T20 Challenge comprising of three teams -- Supernovas, Velocity, and Trailblazers. Mandhana, who captains the Trailblazers in the showpiece event, knows the value of the tournament in building up a strong squad.\"Yeah, I think the kind of performances we\\'ve had in the last three-four years is great. The average age of the Indian women\\'s team is 23-24, which means that there are a lot of young players,\" said Mandhana in a podcast on Red Bull\\'s Decoding Athletes series.\"The league definitely gives a boost to women\\'s cricket and gives confidence to youngsters. We\\'ve seen in men\\'s cricket; debutants are facing 145-150 speed deliveries quite comfortably. You can\\'t see that they\\'re nervous on their debut,\" she further said.\"The league has played a big role in that, and it\\'s going to help women\\'s cricket as well. If you really want to get a strong women\\'s team in India, it\\'s the right time to get a women\\'s league,\" she added.Mandhana, if given a choice, would like to play for Mumbai Indians.\"I think at the moment I\\'m happy to lead Trailblazers. But if given a choice, and because I\\'m from Maharashtra, so Mumbai probably. But I think all the teams are so good and they look after the players so well. Any team would be amazing for development as a player,\" she said.England had defeated India in the finals of the 2017 ODI World Cup and Mandhana admitted that the English side is ahead of them when it comes to ICC tournaments.\"I think it\\'s a very good contest every time we play England. I think whenever you\\'re playing England or Australia you have to be at your best.

Of course, the game didn\\'t go our way. I think we lost control from probably the first batting powerplay,\" said Mandhana.

              " \" United Airlines seeks to build its own diverse pipeline of pilots  United Airlines says it will train 5,000 pilots this decade, including taking on applicants with no flying experience, and plans for half of them to be women or people of color.United will borrow an approach used elsewhere, notably at Germany's Lufthansa, by taking people at the beginning of their flying careers and training them at its own academy, which it bought last year. United will continue to draw pilots from traditional sources such as the military, however.Airline officials said they will begin accepting applicants for United's flight academy on Tuesday.The subject of a pilot shortage — it is not universally accepted that one exists — was hotly discussed in the airline industry before the pandemic hit, then receded as airlines around the world grounded planes and reduced their pilot ranks in response to the the plunge in air travel.Now travel is rebounding, although it still hasn't returned to 2019 levels. United faces a small shortage of pilots in the near term. Last week, United said it will hire about 300 pilots, many of whom had received conditional job offers before travel evaporated last year.The shortage at United and other major carriers will grow more severe in coming years, as large numbers of airline pilots approach the mandatory U.S. retirement age of 65.It is expensive to learn to fly and gain the 1,500 hours of flight time required for U.S. airline pilots — a commonly cited sum is $100,000. To attract applicants, United says it will offer $1.2 million in scholarship aid this year and more in the future, but most applicants will likely need to borrow against the promise that — if successful — in several years they will earn pilot's wages at United.Critics of the current system of pilot training say young pilots gain hours flying small piston-driven planes that bear little resemblance to twin-engine jetliners. United CEO Scott Kirby said training at the airline's Arizona academy, which United bought last year, will be rigorous “and even more focused on safety and preparing people to become commercial airline pilots instead of just pilots of their own airplanes.”United said academy students will get a basic license within two months and a more advanced license within a year. They would gain experience flying for one of United's regional airline partners and could become a United co-pilot or first officer in five years.United announced its plan in a well-choreographed publicity blitz that stressed the airline's hope that half the academy graduates will be women or minorities — groups that are vastly underrepresented in cockpits today. United said about 7% of its pilots are women and 13% are people of color.The airline said it will work with three historically Black schools, Delaware State University, Elizabeth City State University and Hampton University, to find and recruit people for the academy.Carole Hopson, a New Jersey-based United co-pilot who flies Boeing 737s, said she hopes the academy will give young Black women a less circuitous route than she took — from newspaper reporter to working for the NFL and then Foot Locker before learning to fly in her 30s — and give Black girls role models in aviation.“For people who have never seen a pilot who looks like me, that gives them an opportunity to say, ‘Gee whiz, I can do that too,’” Hopson said.

              " ' Gujarat government refutes Congress\\' Covid-19 pandemic mismanagement claims  Refuting the Congress\\' allegation of mismanagement and failure in tackling the coronavirus situation in the state, the BJP government in Gujarat claimed that its track record was far better than other states.Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who handles Health portfolio, said over 80 lakh persons in the state were already given the Covid-19 vaccine, which is a record in the country.\"Our government was always serious about coronavirus and we have implemented various measures in a well-planned manner during the last one year. Compared to other states, Gujarat is way ahead when it comes to fighting this pandemic,\" Patel told reporters at a press conference in Gandhinagar.\"Till now, 80.17 lakh persons have already been vaccinated in the state. This is more than any other state. Instead of helping the government or people in these difficult times, Congress leaders are levelling baseless allegations for political gains,\" the deputy chief minister said.Earlier during the day, Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson of the Congress Shaktisinh Gohil claimed that ICU beds and ventilators were not available for patients, neither in private nor in government-run hospitals.In a statement, Gohil also criticised the government over the issue of vaccination, claiming that the second wave could have been averted if the countrymen had been given preference in vaccination instead of giving the doses to other countries.Former Gujarat Congress President Arjun Modhwadia, in a press conference, alleged that the BJP government in the state is concealing the real figures about tests and infections.\"The BJP government shied away from discussing the issue of coronavirus in the recently held budget session of the state Assembly. This government is concealing figures to hide their failure. Instead of taking serious steps, the BJP only concentrated on elections and post-poll celebrations,\" Modhwadia claimed.Responding to the allegations, Patel said even the High Court and WHO had expressed satisfaction about the work done by the Gujarat government to stem the viral spread.\"We are conducting around 1 lakh tests daily, including 40,000 RT-PCR tests. Gujarat\\'s recovery rate was once 98 per cent, which now stands at 94 per cent. It is true that the number of infections has increased in recent times.

              " ' 19 blood clot deaths in UK after AstraZeneca jab, new advisory issued | 5 points  The UK\\'s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Wednesday advised offering an alternative to AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to adults under 30s amid concerns over blood clot link. The advisory came soon after the EU’s drug regulator announced that the reported cases of blood clotting should be listed as a possible side effect of AstraZeneca\\'s Covid-19 vaccine.\"We are not advising a stop to any vaccination for any individual in any age group. We are advising a preference for one vaccine over another vaccine for a particular age group, really out of the utmost caution, rather than because we have any serious safety concerns,\" Wei Shen Lim, Covid-19 Chair for JCVI, said at a briefing.At least 79 cases of blood clots alongside low levels of platelets were reported in Britain as of March 31, according to the latest data released by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Out of 79 cases, 44 were of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a type of blood clot in the brain. The MHRA said that 19 people have died, which includes 13 females and 6 males.“No effective medicine or vaccine is without risk. We continually monitor safety during widespread use of any vaccine. This is to ensure vaccines are performing as expected, to identify any new side effects that may arise, and to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks,” Dr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, said at the briefing.Key points of MHRA’s new advisory related to the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine:The MHRA’s scientific review has concluded that the evidence of a link with AstraZeneca\\'s Covid-19 vaccine is stronger but more work is still needed.The regulator said that the overall risk of these blood clots is approximately 4 people in a million who receive the vaccine.Citing the latest data, the MHRA suggested that there is a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.It advised that the evolving evidence should be taken into account when considering the use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.It has urged everyone who did not have these side effects to come forward for their second dose when invited.

              " ' In two months, 10 stranded leopard cubs reunited with mothers in Junnar  Three leopard cubs not more than 15 days old, who were found stranded in a sugarcane field in Vadgaon Sahani village, in Pune district’s Junnar taluka last week, were reunited with their mother on during the early hours of Tuesday. This is the second such rescue operation in the area since March 20, when two 45-day-old cubs (similarly found in a sugarcane field in Junnar’s Ozar village), were reunited with their mother. A total of 10 cubs have been rescued and reunited with their mothers since February in the region.In all cases, the cubs were found by farmers who were harvesting sugarcane crops, the season for which runs from December to late March-early April. Officials said that farmers in the area are accustomed to the occasional sight of leopards, especially around this time of the year. The farmers immediately altered the district forest office, who in turn roped in rescuers with Wildlife SOS, which runs a leopard rescue and rehabilitation centre in Junnar.“While harvesting their sugarcane crops, local farmers stumbled upon three tiny leopard cubs huddled together amidst the tall, dense fields in Vadgaon Sahani village... The cubs were brought to the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Center for a brief medical examination. Identified as two males and one female, the cubs were estimated to be about fifteen-days-old,” Wildlife SOS said in a statement.Veterinarian Dr. Nikhil Bangar, who examined the cubs for ticks and injuries, found them to be in good health. An initial attempt to reunite the lost cubs with their mother on the weekend remained unsuccessful. However, the cubs were placed in a box and left in the same field where they were found late Monday night.“After a long night of waiting, the mother leopard was seen slowly approaching the field at dawn. Relieved to be reunited with her cubs, the leopard quickly knocked over the box and took her precious babies away to a safer location,” said Dr Bangar. The operation was captured with a camera trap placed nearby.Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “Harvest season in Maharashtra often coincides with leopard cub season, which puts both humans and these elusive wild cats in a rather sensitive and conflicting situation. We are grateful to the villagers who took the right step by informing the Forest Department.”Yogesh Ghodke, Range Forest Officer in charge of the area, explained that the Junnar region has a significant leopard population, which -- due to rapid loss of forest cover -- are being forced to seek safe refuge in tall, dense sugarcane fields, leading to such encounters.

              " ' Russia ready to supply military equipment to Pakistan, hold more drills: Lavrov  Russia stands ready to supply special military equipment to Pakistan to strengthen its counter-terrorism capabilities, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday as Islamabad rolled out the red carpet for the visiting leader. Lavrov, who travelled to Islamabad from New Delhi, also spoke of Russia’s plans to conduct more military and naval exercises with Pakistan and to further deepen bilateral ties. Lavrov also met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan, who raised the Kashmir issue during their talks. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi personally received Lavrov – the first senior Russian leader to travel to Pakistan in almost a decade – at the airport on his arrival on Tuesday, signalling the importance attached to the visit by Islamabad. “We’ve confirmed that we stand ready to strengthen the anti-terrorist potential of Pakistan, including by supplying Pakistan with special military equipment. This serves the interests of all states of the region,” Lavrov said during a joint news conference with Qureshi after their meeting on Wednesday. “We also agreed that we need to further conduct exercises and drills in the mountains called Druzhba (friendship) and maritime exercises called the Arabian Monsoon,” he added. The Druzbha exercise between the Pakistani and Russian militaries, which began in 2016, usually features special forces from both sides. A Russian Army contingent visited Pakistan last November for the latest edition of the drill. Russia had angered India by supplying a limited number of Mi-35M helicopter gunships to Pakistan in 2018. Lavrov’s comments about potential supplies of special military equipment, even to bolster Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities, are unlikely to go down well in New Delhi, which perceives such arms deals as a provocation. Without directly referring to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that includes India, Australia, Japan and the US, Lavrov took a swipe at US-backed strategies that he said were affecting stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Lavrov has been critical of the Indo-Pacific concept, which is the focus of the Quad. Noting that he and Qureshi had discussed the situation in the Asia-Pacific, Lavrov said: “Here we see uncertain processes that happen because the US promotes divisive strategies that change everything and the stability in the region. We are categorically against new division lines. Instead we promote the preservation of those structures that have been here, including the key role of Asean.” There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Lavrov’s comments. Enhanced defence and security cooperation also figured in Lavrov’s meeting with Pakistan Army chief Gen Bajwa. According to a readout from the Pakistani military’s media arm, Bajwa said that “Pakistan values its relations with Russia and reciprocates the desire for enhanced bilateral military cooperation”. Bajwa welcomed all initiatives to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. “We have no hostile designs towards any country and will keep on working towards a cooperative regional framework based on sovereign equality and mutual progress,” he said. Both Qureshi and Prime Minister Khan raised the Kashmir issue in their discussions with Lavrov. Qureshi said at the joint news conference that he had told Lavrov about the “fragility of the situation on our border with India” and concerns about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and human rights issues. However, Qureshi also acknowledged that tensions with India had reduced after the Indian and Pakistan armies recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. During his meeting with Lavrov, Khan underlined the importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Russia as a “key foreign policy priority”, and expressed satisfaction at “steady growth in bilateral ties, including deepening cooperation in trade, energy, security and defence”, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. “With reference to the situation in [Jammu and Kashmir], the Prime Minister shared Pakistan’s perspective on issues of peace and security in South Asia, including the need for peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” the statement said. Lavrov said at the joint news conference that he and Qureshi had touched upon the fact that India and Pakistan have started talks on the normalisation of relations. “We welcome that,” he said. The reception given to Lavrov in Islamabad was in contrast to his brief visit to New Delhi, where he only held talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. Lavrov didn’t meet the Indian prime minister - usually a part of any senior Russian leader’s visit to New Delhi. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Credai-Pune Metro to conduct mass vaccination drive for construction workers  Credai and Pune Metro have planned a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive for construction labourers across the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) regions, according to office bearers. The association, which has received support from municipal authorities, will strengthen the vaccination drive that will benefit millions of labourers after getting requisite approvals from the government. During last year’s lockdown period, the association was involved in several activities including setting up ICU units and oxygen beds in government-run hospitals, distributing rations to the poor and distributing sanitisers, masks and cooked food to the labourers at construction sites. Apart from that, the association has expressed concerns over the hike in interest rates by several banks, including the State Bank of India (SBI), and has said that such a move will further weaken the already struggling real estate sector. Anil Pharande, president, Credai, said, “With measures like lower interest rates from banks and reduction in stamp duty last year there was some hope for the industry’s revival, but unfortunately, banks have again hiked their interest rates which can have an adverse effect on the sector. There are around 250 allied industries along with millions of labourers dependent on real estate. It should be reconsidered.” The association has also said that migration of labourers due to the second wave of Covid-19 can spell more trouble as the developers who are struggling to meet the deadlines and commitments need the workers at their sites.“The real estate sector has just begun to revive and there have been reports of migrants leaving the city due to the fear of another lockdown. We are already providing sanitisation and hygiene measures and medical treatment at the labour camps, but another migration will prove uncertain for the revival of the sector,” said Pharande.

              " ' Pune RTO reports drop in overall vehicle registrations, excluding ambulances, tractors  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a considerable drop in vehicle registrations have been reported for the financial year 2020-21 at the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO), excluding ambulances and tractors. Most sectors faced an economic crunch last year due to a complete lockdown, and a similar drop was seen in auto sales and registrations. However, while all other vehicle registrations dropped, there was a considerable increase in the number of ambulance and tractor sales and registrations. Due to the pandemic situation, several private and government bodies purchased new ambulances. On a similar note, in the agriculture sector, the demand and supply were huge throughout the year and hence, many farmers purchased new tractors for their day-to-day farming work. The highest number of ambulances registered was in 2020-21, in comparison to data from the last five years. A total of 108 ambulances were registered in 2020-21; 45 ambulances in 2019-2020; 48 ambulances in 2018-2019; 76 ambulances in 2017-2018; and 31 ambulances in 2016-2017. Similarly, the last financial year saw a total of 2,160 tractor registrations, the highest number in the last five years in the Pune RTO division. A total of 1,530 tractors were registered in 2019-2020; 1,200 tractors were registered in 2018-2019; 853 tractors were registered in 2017-2018; and 1,249 tractors were registered in 2016-2017. Last year, a total of 1,43,958 vehicles of 17 different types were registered under the Pune RTO division from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021.Before that, in every financial year the number was two lakh and higher. In 2019-20 it was 2, 47,225; in 2018-19 it was 2, 61,410; in 2017-18 it was 2,91,117; and in 2016-17 it was 2,70,307. There has been a drastic drop by 1,03,267 vehicles registration in the previous financial year compared to data from the last five years. “There was a decrease in the number of total vehicles registered under the Pune RTO division with above 1 lakh vehicles in comparison to previous financial years. It was an impact of Covid-19 pandemic and we hope that this financial year there is a good response to overall vehicle sales and registrations.” said Pune deputy regional transport officer Sanjeev Bhor. Prashant Bandal, president of Shivshakati Tarun Mandal from Kothrud who bought an ambulance last year to help patients said, “The situation was worse after August last year, there were no beds and even ambulances were not available. So, members of our mandal decided to buy a new ambulance with individual contributions and started a free service for public,” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Indiscriminate use, hoarding of Remdesivir create injection shortage in Pune  Pune: City hospitals have started facing acute shortage of Remdesivir as there has been a surge in demand for the injection. As per the current needs, Pune requires at least 8,000-8,500 vials of the drug daily and gets a supply of about 16,000-17,000 vials every alternate day. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have stated that hoarding of the injection could cause artificial shortage while Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that indiscriminate use of the life-saving injection is being administered without following protocol issued on March 23 this year. To curb the misuse of the drug, the district administrations have now been asked to investigate any indiscriminate use of the drug and also capped the price of the drug between ₹1,100 and ₹1,400. The health minister on Wednesday said that to curb the shortage of oxygen the state might also decide to shut industries that consume maximum oxygen. During the Wednesday’s press conference, Tope said that all district administrations have been asked to ensure that every injection is used judiciously. “During the meeting with officials from each district, I stressed on the monitoring if there’s any indiscriminate use of Remdesivir. The state is getting 50,000 doses every day and all of them are being consumed, leading to shortage,” said Tope. The anti-viral dose is being used to treat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome patients before it was directed for Covid-19 treatment last year. Currently, doctors and hospitals are prescribing the injection even for those suffering with mild problem of breathlessness, Tope said, adding it’s a violation of the protocol. In view of those instructions, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has instructed Covid hospitals to buy only the required stock of Remdesivir and not to hoard stock. Also, hospitals have been asked to maintain a register with each patient’s name and address to ensure that the right patient gets the injection. The hospital must return unused vials to the patient’s relative. FDA joint commissioner for Pune division, SB Patil, said, “Pune needs about 8,000 vials daily as of now and we have only 4,000 vials available. We will get replenishments by tonight. We usually get 16-17 thousand vials every alternate day so there is no shortage as of now. We have hospitals to ensure that they have to buy only the required vials of Remdesivir and not stock estimating for the future.” Tope said the process to increase beds in all major hospitals has begun. Tope said, “We will increase 200 more beds for Covid in BJ medical college, 200 at Dalvi, 500 at Baner and 200 at COEP. To cope with shortage of oxygen, if need be, we will shut the industrial units consuming maximum oxygen and the refilling sites will be monitored to ensure any leakage.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Cash for judgement: ACB arrests Gaikwad’s associate in bribery case  The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has arrested Ajay Gopinathan, an associate of the main accused, Shubhavari Gaikwad, in connection with the cash-for-favourable judgement bribery case, which has already seen the arrest of Wadgaon Maval’s sitting judge, Archana Jatkar, on April 1. Gopinathan is known to Gaikwad and has been remanded to police custody until April 8 by special judge SR Navander. According to the ACB sleuths, Gaikwad and Gopinathan are known to each other for the past year-and-a-half. On the day of her arrest, Gaikwad had given her old mobile handset to Gopinathan. When interrogated over the issue, she has been giving evasive answers, public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare Patil informed the court during his submissions. Patil demanded police custody on grounds that voice samples had to be recorded. Wadgaon Maval judicial magistrate (first class) Archana Jatkar whose role was under the scanner by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was arrested by the ACB at 11 am on April 1. Jatkar whose bail application was rejected by the Supreme Court (SC) surrendered at the ACB office after which she was immediately taken into custody and placed under arrest. The court rejected her bail application and, in its order, sent her to police custody until April 5. The district court later released her on bail. The investigation report in the bribery case was lodged at Dehuroad police station for offences under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the prevention of corruption act. The ACB has already arrested Shubhavari Bhalchandra Gaikwad (29), a resident of Talegaon; Sushant Baban Kenjale (35) of Ravet; and dismissed police inspector Bhanudas, alias Anil Jadhav of Mumbai. They are currently lodged in jail under magisterial custody remand (MCR), while Ajay Gopinathan , a resident of Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, was wanted in the case until Wednesday. Jatkar was under ACB radar since the arrest of Shubhavari Gaikwad on January 15, who was caught red-handed accepting a bribe of ₹2.5 lakh. Gaikwad had promised to manage the court’s decision in favour of the complainant identified as Swapnil Madhukar Shevkar, a resident of Induri in Maval taluka. Shevkar who runs a milk dairy in the name ‘Kadjai Mata Dudh Sankalan’, used to supply milk to Amul dairy of Khed. Gaikwad approached him on January 4-5 falsely pretending to be ‘Mhatre Madam’ and told him that there is a criminal case filed against him in the court of the applicant judicial officer. She also showed him a copy of a criminal complaint and pointed out that it was posted for hearing on January 6 and gave him an assurance that the case will be dismissed by the presiding officer if he made a payment of ₹5 lakh. Shevkar showed displeasure after which she reduced the amount to ₹3 lakh. The complainant, therefore, approached the office of ACB on January 6 and filed a complaint, after which a trap was laid leading to her arrest. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Vaccination camps at workplaces on the cards  Private firms from Pune will soon hold Covid vaccination camps at workplaces, following permission from the government. The programme will be launched from April 11 and all states and union territories have been asked to stay ready with preparations. “I’m very glad to finally see this circular. We have been asking for this for the past few days. Many Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) members are very keen to launch vaccinations on their premises,” said Prashant Girbane, director general, MCCIA Pune. Around 3,000 companies are associated with the MCCIA of which 200 have already shown an interest in the vaccination camps. The letter from the Central government states, “With support of the state governments/UT administration, the efforts have been to consistently make the vaccination drive more pragmatic and also more acceptable and purposeful to the beneficiaries”. “On similar lines, in order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations, Covid-19 vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing Covid Vaccination Centre (CVC),” the letter states. “We have already shared the first list of such companies with the district administration. We will look forward to working with the district authorities and supporting them in this initiative to vaccinate most company employees at the company premises so that there is more bandwidth available with the district machinery to vaccinate others. Together we shall achieve the goals of wider and speedy vaccination among the eligible ones,” added Girbane. Companies like Bharat Forge, Atlas Copco, Thermax, GE India Industrial Private Limited, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India are few firms ready to conduct the vaccination camps. Companies like ADP India have also decided to sponsor the Covid-19 vaccines for all employees. Employees only The letter also states that only employees of the workplace aged 45 years and above will be allowed to take the vaccination. No outsider including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination at the “CVC at workplace.” Beneficiaries must be registered on the Co-win portal prior to vaccination. CVC nodal officers will ensure registrations of all targeted beneficiaries and on the spot, registrations will also be available but only to employees of the workplace. Vaccination in housing societies Many hosuing societies have been also planning to hold vaccination camps. However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is yet to take a decision on the same.In Pune, the PMC allowed Amanora Township to start a vaccination centre on its premises to benefit residents of the area. “During the Covid-19 pandemic everyone is required to wear a mask, maintain social distance and observe hygiene. I also appeal to all citizens above the age of 45 to take advantage of such vaccination drives,” said Chetan Tupe, MLA from Hadapsar during the inauguration of the Covid Vaccination Centre set up by the Pune Municipal Corporation at Amanora Township.

Udhayanidhi claimed that the two BJP leaders were \"unable to tolerate the pressure and torture\" given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and died due to it.The EC asked him to respond to the notice before 5pm on Wednesday, \"failing which the Commission shall take a decision without any further reference to you\".Udhayanidhi, in his reply, stated that the \"tenor and intention of his entire speech must be appreciated\" to decide the context of the extracted two lines and urged the EC to furnish a transcript of the entire speech for him so that he can file a full and proper reply.\"At the outset I deny that I have committed any breach of the model code of conduct,\" Udhayanidhi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.In his response, Udhayanidhi said that he was only responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s accusation against him at a poll rally that he had reached high political office in DMK through short cut methods.\"The impugned speech is nothing but answer to that criticism wherein I have said that Mr Narendra Modi became Prime Minister only through short cut methods overlooking other senior leaders in BJP party while he was chief minister of Gujarat,\" said Udhayanidhi.\"I said that I was having a list of senior leaders who were sidelined by him. I gave the names of Mr (LK) Advani, Mr Yashwant Sinha, Late Mrs Sushma Swaraj and Mr Arun Jaitley. The words pressure and torture were not used by me in the said context as sought to be projected in the showcause notice,\" the DMK leader claimed.The said lines, he said, if appreciated in spirit of the delivery of the entire speech taken as a whole, do not breach the mode code.The notice had said the EC received a complaint from the BJP alleging that Udhayanidhi Stalin, while addressing a political gathering at Dharapuram on March 31, made a statement that \"Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley (both Union ministers) died unable to tolerate the pressure and torture given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\".Slapping the notice on DMK leader who has campaigned for his southern party DMK, the EC said that it is of the view that the contents of the speech made by him violated the provision of MCC which states that \"criticism of other political parties, when made, shall be confined to their policies and programme, past record and work.\"The EC also said that the parties and candidates shall refrain from criticism of all aspects of private life, not connected with the public activities of the leaders or workers of other parties.\"Criticism of other parties or their workers based on unverified allegations or distortion shall be avoided,\" it had said.Tamil Nadu voted in single-phase assembly election on Tuesday with 3,998 candidates and 234 assembly constituencies in the contest.The polling brought the fierce election campaign to an end as the 6.28 crore voters of Tamil Nadu exercised their franchise in the amid strict Covid-19 safety protocols.The state recorded 72.78% polling with Karur recording the highest of 83.92% while Chennai the lowest turnout of 59.06 per cent.

              " ' Students of Classes 9, 11 to be promoted without exams  On Wednesday, the Maharashtra state education department announced that students of Classes 9 and 11 will be promoted directly without any examination. Priya Salunkhe, a student of Class 9 from a Pune-based school said that there was a lot of confusion initially, but now she is happy with the decision. “Earlier there was no clarity about the exams. Now that the exams are cancelled, I feel much better. The whole year we have adjusted to online education and with the ongoing confusion on whether the exam will be conducted or not there was a lot of stress. The decision is good. I can now fully focus on class 10 syllabus as it matters more,” said Salunkhe. Amruta Kulkarni, a parent of a Class 9 student said that the school exam timetable was just out. “The students were very anxious and confused because of the uncertainty, but the decision is welcomed. However, I feel at an individual school level, schools should continue taking tests so that the child builds confidence, and the doubts of the student will be clarified. This will also ensure that students know how much they have understood the syllabus as class 9 is important for concepts that are later taught in class 11 but now that the burden of exams are over, students can start focusing on Class 10 and Class 12,” said Kulkarni. Archana Kakade, Pune-based parent whose son is in Class 11 this year said that the colleges have just started, and the first online unit test is scheduled in April. “There is a lot of confusion and especially among Class 11 students. The academic year started late due to the admission process. If it was not for private coaching, my son would have faced a lot of challenges for this year. The syllabus in the coaching was completed fairly quickly and this has helped my son,” said Kakade. She further added that students from other streams like Commerce and Arts are facing a lot of issues. “Class 11 is the base for many important concepts. Now that the burden of exams for this year are over, the child can focus on Class 12th completely and the competitive exams,” said Kakade. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' \\'Anil Deshmukh demanded ₹2 crore...\\': Sachin Vaze in explosive letter to NIA  Suspended cop Sachin Vaze on Wednesday claimed that former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh demanded ₹2 crore from him to continue his service in the Mumbai Police and alleged another minister Anil Parab asked him to collect money from contractors.Transport minister Parab rejected the allegations made by Vaze, saying they were incorrect and aimed at maligning his image, and expressed readiness to face any probe.Vaze, who was reinstated in the police service last year, made the sensational claim in a letter which he tried to submit before a special NIA court here.Also Read: A month later, 9 unanswered questions in the Antilia-Hiran-Vaze caseHowever, special judge PR Sitre refused to take his letter on record and asked him to follow the required procedure.Vaze, an accused in the case of an explosives-laden car found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani\\'s residence in south Mumbai and the death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, is currently in the NIA custody.Deshmukh, a senior NCP leader, resigned as home minister on Monday after the Bombay high court ordered a CBI probe into corruption allegations levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.The controversial assistant police inspector said that NCP president Sharad Pawar, whose party is a key constituent in the MVA government, apparently wanted him to be placed under suspension again.\"I duly was reinstated in service on June 6, 2020. That soon after my reinstatement there were certain agitators (people, who wanted) to reverse the reinstatement.\"Apparently, then it was ordered by Sharad Pawar to again place me under suspension.\"That, at that time the then home minister sir (Deshmukh) also told me that he will convince Pawar saheb and for that purpose he (HM sir) asked me to pay ₹2 crore,\" Vaze claimed in the four-page handwritten letter.Vaze (49) said he expressed his inability to pay such a huge sum.Also Read: Sachin Vaze didn’t report to his boss but Param Bir Singh: Mumbai CP’s report\"I had expressed my inability to pay such an amount. On this, the home minister sir asked me to pay in later course,\" he added.Vaze claimed that at a meeting in the Sahyadri guest house in south Mumbai, Deshmukh had asked him to look into a complaint related to the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) which was under preliminary enquiry.SBUT is a non-profit organisation tasked with carrying out a mega redevelopment project in the Bhendi Bazaar area of south Mumbai.Deshmukh had asked him to bring the trustees of the SBUT to him for \"negotiation\" about the enquiry, Vaze claimed.\"He also insisted to initiate primary talks to get ₹50 crore from the SBUT in order to close the said enquiry. I had expressed my inability to do any such things as I do not know anyone from the SBUT and I also did not have any control over the enquiry,\" Vaze added.Vaze\\'s letter claimed that in January 2021, another state minister Anil Parab asked him to look into an inquiry against \"fraudulent\" contractors listed in the BMC and collect at least ₹2 crore from about 50 such contractors.The said inquiry was based on an anonymous complaint, Vaze added.Parab, a Shiv Sena leader, rejected Vaze\\'s claims and said he was ready to face any probe into the allegations.Talking to reporters, Parab said, \"I swear in the name of Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and my two daughters that I haven\\'t done anything wrong.\"He said there was a BJP strategy to malign the image of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the MVA government.\"By targeting me, a close aide of the chief minister, they think they can put the government in trouble. BJP leaders have been saying for the last two days that another wicket will fall. This conspiracy was being hatched that time as they knew Vaze will give such a letter,\" Parab said.The letter also claimed that Deshmukh had asked Vaze to collect ₹3 lakh to ₹3.5 lakh each from around1,650 bars and restaurants in Mumbai (this claimed had been made by Vaze earlier also).The suspended cop claimed to have informed the then police commissioner Singh about these developments.\"I also expressed my apprehension to (Singh) that somewhere in the future I would be embroiled in a false controversy,\" he added.\"The then CP encouraged me and categorically instructed me to not to involve in any such illegal collection of money from anyone and for anyone,\" Vaze claimed.Singh had earlier claimed that Deshmukh had asked police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh has denied any wrongdoing.Vaze also claimed that in November 2020, he was approached by a person called Darshan Ghodawat.Ghodawat had introduced himself as a \"very close circle person\" of a senior cabinet minister and explained to him about the illegal gutkha and tobacco trade in Maharashtra, Vaze said.\"Ghodawat insisted that I should collect ₹100 crore from these illegal gutkha sellers. I had categorically (said no to) do any such illegal act,\" Waze added.Meanwhile, the NIA custody of Vaze, arrested by the central agency on March 13, was extended till April 9 by the special court.Vaze was reinstated in June last year after being under suspension for over 15 years for his alleged role in a custodial death case.Credited with eliminating 63 alleged criminals in encounters, the 1990-batch officer of the state cadre was suspended in 2004 over his alleged role in the custodial death of the 2002 Ghatkopar blast suspect Khwaja Yunus.

              " ' Pune artistes change professions to cope with, and survive lockdown uncertainties  Pune: For many stage artistes, the 2020 lockdown was a sort of bring down the curtain on their career. They had to change their profession for survival and now fresh restrictions have left them with uncertainties. With no permission for stage shows throughout the year, artistes explored various options for financial support. Prasad Kulkarni who is known for his magic tricks across Pune was left with no work in 2020 due to restriction on public shows. Along with colleagues, he started Kulkarni vada pav centre on Sinhgad road in May 2020. “We sold one vada pav for one rupee during the first three days to attract customers. It worked as people started visiting our shop regularly. With people liking our quality, financially things began to fall in place for us,” said Kulkarni. With restrictions imposed again, Kulkarni and his colleagues are in a spot, again, apprehensive about the future of their vada pav centre. “With only the parcel system allowed, the business had definitely hit and it is the same for all eateries. We changed our profession to survive, but if this also does not allow us to earn then it will become difficult to survive,” said Kulkarni whose video online on problems faced due to the lockdown got viral. “Actually the video was to only portray the difficulties people are facing and there was no political motive against the state government. Many people took it the wrong way and now I am getting calls asking for explanations about the video. Breaking the chain of Covid transmission is a must, but total lockdown will hurt the economic condition badly,” Kulkarni said. Another artiste, Chaitali Majgaonkar Bhandari, who is a stand-up comedian from the city was left with zero income for seven months (March-September, 2020) before she started selling puppets online. “Before the lockdown, I had a monthly income of ₹1 lakh which went to zero. From October I started to sell puppets which brought me stability. I used to conduct online shows, but it is completely different then performing in front of a live audience. “Thing were getting normal and I did many shows between December-February. Now activities are again on halt due to the lockdown and it will make things difficult for many artistes,” said Bhandari. “Artistes are creative people and many find ways to survive, but some will not cope with another long lockdown,” she said.

              " ' Jisshu Sengupta: Today with OTT, it is no more about star power  Actor Jisshu Sengupta is riding high on the current OTT wave in India, and says the ever-growing diverse world of web has blurred the lines between industries, helping him make his way to south filmdom. “The main reason behind the blurring lines between the industries is the growth of OTT. Whether you are sitting in the South, East or West, people are watching the content from there through the streaming services. So, people are getting to know about the actors. And that’s where we come in,” shares Sengupta, adding: “Today, it is not about star power. It is only about the content”. After building his repertoire in Bengali film industry, Sengupta gradually made his way into Bollywood, and started getting noticed through films such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero (2005), Barfi! (2012) and Mardaani (2014). Having achieved a star status in Bengal, he did not snap his ties with Hindi film industry, but instead strengthened it by exploring web projects. “I might be a star in Bengal. I might be a hero in Bengal, but I believe myself to be an actor (first). I have already done seven Telugu films, and I’m doing three more right now. I’m doing a lot of work in Hindi. So people have begun to know me,” says the actor, who was recently seen in OTT projects such as Shakuntala Devi, Sadak 2, Durgamati: The Myth, and Criminal Justice season 2.And through his work, Sengupta has managed to cement his position in the Hindi film industry. “In Mumbai, people knew me for a really long time. I have worked with Shyam Benegal, Sujoy Ghosh, Anurag Basu, Shoojit Sircar and Pradeep Sarkar. They and others in Mumbai know the kind of work I have done,” he tells us. However, the National-Award winning actor credits the booming digital space for opening more doors for him. “Down south, it started because many people saw me in Typewriter, and then in Criminal Justice. Now, they know the kind of actor I am. And that is the main reason how the lines are getting blurred,” says the 44-year-old. Next, he will soon be seen alongside Salman Khan in film, Antim: The Final Truth, and Chiranjeevi in Telugu film Acharya.“I am playing a negative role in Antim. It was great and fun working with Salman. He really is a down to earth and sweet. He doesn’t talk much, and talks just about films, technique or the technicalities of making a film. It was great knowing him,” says the actor, who is also working on his autobiography. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The actor says work has found a new place in his life post the pandemic. “I am very elated and excited to work. Because lockdown mein toh hum sab ghar par hi bethe the, aur tadap rahe the bahar nikalne ko aur kaam karne ko,” Samrat tells us. After living through the new realities brought upon the pandemic, Samrat has got to know the value of work, meeting people, and human interaction -- and that is something he will never take for granted. “I feel blessed that there is work at hand. Whosoever gets a chance to work, it is a blessing, we should not take it for granted,” says the 37-year-old, who took the small screen route to get into showbiz.In fact, now, he is detached from the whole concept of hit and flop, and wants to just focus on working. “Hit aur flop mein kuch nahi rakha hai. Agar hit deke bhi main ghar par lockdown pe betha hun, toh main kya hi ukhad raha hun,” Samrat observes, before going on to explain his definition of happiness. “At the end of the day, it is about you being happy, and not attaching that happiness to a condition that yeh hoga toh main khush ho jaunga, ya nahi hua toh mein udas ho jaunga. You are blessed if you have a good family, you wake up every morning, and all the people you know are alive and well,” says the actor, who has started prepping for the third instalment of Fukrey franchise. Samrat made his television debut as Lakshya Virani in the popular show, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, in 2006. Though he quit the show soon, he was noticed, and found a way into Bollywood. He went on to do films such as Bittoo Boss (2012), Fukrey (2013), Bangistan (2015), Sanam Re (2016), and Fukrey Returns (2017).Next, he will soon be seen as a “happy go lucky guy from Delhi” in the film, Suswagatam Khushaamadeed. “There are other diverse roles in the pipeline, which I am excited about,” he says.

              " ' FALSE: No truth to 45 people from Akshay Kumar’s Ram Setu crew testing Covid positive  Akshay Kumar’s recent Covid diagnosis sent Bollywood into a tizzy, as he is probably the busiest A-lister today, with multiple projects announced or being on floors. His latest film, Ram Setu had just kicked off it’s shooting recently with the lead cast, when the actor tested positive and announced it on social media.However, immediately after that, a story started doing the rounds that 45 people have tested positive on the same film’s sets, or during the shoot. The makers, however, deny it outright. Vikram Malhotra, Abundantia Entertainment, who is co-producing the film, says this is “absolutely inaccurate and a total misrepresentation of facts.”He reveals that as part of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) laid down for the safety of everyone on a shoot, advance and frequent Covid tests are carried out for all crew members. “In line with the same, and ahead of the shoot to be held on April 5 in Madh Island, around 190 people were tested on 3rd at an off-location testing camp in Versova, Mumbai from which a certain number were to be selected for the shoot. Out of these 190-odd people, 25 people tested positive and were, therefore, removed from those who qualified to be part of the unit for shoot the next day,” he says.Reiterating that none of those individuals were ever a part of the unit or present on the film’s set, Malhotra continues, “The expenses for this off-location testing and all such tests is borne entirely by the film’s production and is monitored by the production team.”Kumar being infected with the virus, he says, had nothing to do with these tests or those 45 people being diagnosed positive. “The shoot lined up for April 5 had to be suspended. There is absolutely no connection or correlation between the two developments as the very shoot that is being quoted in the false story never took place!,” Malhotra clarifies.Further, also as part of the protocol, crew members who were in proximity of Kumar have been tested and have followed self-isolation. Nushrratt Bharuccha and Jacqueline Fernandez, his co-stars, too have followed the safety procedures and got tested. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' SGPC writes to Twitter CEO to block hateful tweets against Sikhs  Comparing hateful tweets against Sikhs with the anti-Jew propaganda of the Nazis in Germany, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Wednesday asked Twitter to block handles posting hate speeches against the community.In a letter to the chief executive officer (CEO) of the microblogging and social networking service Jack Dorsey, the gurdwara body president Bibi Jagir Kaur has sought instructions for Twitter’s India-based staff to monitor, flag and remove hateful tweets against Sikhs.She termed the ‘direct and deleterious hate-filled’ tweets against the Sikhs as the result of state farmers’ movement against the three agri-laws that the Centre has passed. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping on the borders of Delhi since November 26, demanding a repeal of these laws.“Sikh organisations have supported farmers’ movement in India. Since then, there have been a lot of direct and deleterious hate-filled tweets against Sikhs on Twitter. These hate tweets have intensified after the recent resolution passed by the SGPC against the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS)’s bid to make India a Hindu Rashtra,” Kaur says in the letter.The apex gurdwara management body had passed the resolution last month during its budget session. The resolution had also called upon the Centre to work for the protection of the rights and freedom of religion of all religions instead of being ready to implement RSS’ efforts. In response, BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said that the SGPC kept raising false bogey of Hindu Rashtra to cover up its failures, especially in terms of the Sikhs embracing Christianity in Punjab.The SGPC chief termed the hate tweets an attempt to create bitterness between Hindus and Sikhs. “At the same time, after the unfortunate incident in Malout with Abohar MLA Arun Narang, there has been an open attempt to create hate against the Sikhs and also bitterness between Hindus and Sikhs,” she said, alleging that calls of repeating 1984 genocide with the Sikhs, calling farmers as terrorists are commonplace on Twitter.

Several non-essential shops opened on Wednesday, and even the police were on the backfoot with no major action taken. The Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) has given an April 9 ultimatum to the state government to allow the opening of shops, or else, on Friday, all shop owners in Pune will open their shops at 10.30 am. A protest has been planned on Thursday, from 11 am to noon, where traders and shop owners will walk along Laxmi road, from Vijay Talkies to Quartergate chowk. “Due to these new strict restrictions imposed by the state government, traders are very angry, not only in Pune, but across the state. A meeting was held of all the trader associations across Pune district and it was unanimously decided to protest against this injustice. All the shop owners and traders will be protesting on Laxmi road with social distancing and holding banners in hand. On Friday if the new orders are not given, then all non-essential shop owners will open up their shops from 10.30 am till 6 pm,” said Fatechand Ranka, president of the association. Kiran Baheti, a shop owner on Tilak road said, “I cannot afford to keep my shop closed for even a single day, as I am paying ₹30,000 rent per month. Already there is no business and when we were hoping to do some business during the Gudi Padwa festival, these restrictions were imposed.” Pune city BJP party leaders also protested against the new restrictions. BJP MLA Madhuri Misal said, “When we had a meeting with the deputy chief minister last Friday, there was discussion about strict restrictions. Suddenly, after the chief minister’s address, the new norms were declared to close down all shops, which is not right. We protest against it.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' China capable of launching cyber-attacks against India, says CDS Gen Rawat  Chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday said China was ahead of India in technology, and it was capable of launching cyber-attacks against India. He said the biggest gap between the two countries was in the cyber domain and it was being addressed in a serious manner.“We know China is capable of launching cyber-attacks on us. And that it (China) can disrupt a large amount of our systems,” Rawat said in response to a question after delivering a talk on Shaping the Armed Forces to Meet Likely Current and Future Challenges. Vivekananda International Foundation organised the event.Rawat said India was trying to create systems for cyber defence to deal with such attacks. He said cyber agencies in the military were working to ensure that “the downtime and the effect of a cyber-attack” did not last long.“We should be able to overcome cyber-attacks and continue with our systems either through an alternative or preventive means through firewalls. So, while we are trying to create firewalls for cyber-attacks, yet we are quite sure they (China) will be able to break through the firewalls…But then what we are trying to do is how long will your system be down, and how will you be able to operate through that phase of cyber-attack you have been put through. That is one thing we are looking at and addressing in a serious manner,” he said.The CDS’s comments come at a time when India and China are locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh and efforts are underway to withdraw front-line troops and weaponry from friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).Rawat said India was developing new technologies to bridge the gap with China. The CDS said closing the technology gap with the neighbour would require integration of the resources of the three services.“The three services are at different levels as far as our technology orientation is concerned. The navy is far ahead of the army and the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the way they have imbibed technology. If you integrate, you will at least be able to catch up with them (China). We may not be able to fully catch up with China, so we are trying to develop some kind of a relationship with western nations to see how we can get better support from them during peacetime at least to see how we can overcome this deficiency,” Rawat said.Cyber has, perhaps, come to acquire a pivotal position in any nation’s security architecture, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“While preparing to acquire offensive capability, it is critical that one’s own systems are protected. While we may be lagging behind China, our nation does not lack cerebral capital to catch up unlike in other capital acquisitions. All efforts must be made to tap the nation’s inherent cyber know-how to protect our vital infrastructure from cyber intrusions,” Bahadur said.Responding to a question on the challenges to theaterisation and the ongoing efforts to bring about jointness among the three services, Rawat said India as a nation believed in status quo and there was always a hesitation to change.“Also, there is a feeling amongst the three services that army being a very large service --- compared to navy and IAF --- will possibly usurp the two entities and everything will become army-centric. I think this is a misnomer because the army, navy and IAF have their own specialties. They will retain their autonomy and integration will only ensure that we have systems that at least operate together,” Rawat said.On women in the armed forces, the CDS said the services were opening more roles to them and there were some areas where they were performing better than men and vice-versa. He said the armed forces were looking at exploiting the capabilities of both men and women and ensuring they were utilised in roles they were best suited for.“There are some tasks that are better performed by women. For example, when we look at cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum computing --- areas where you need concentration and the ability to sit long hours on the desk --- we have found that the women workforce is better capable than the men folk. So somewhere the women have shown better capability and there are some areas where men have better capability,” Rawat said.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.This year, the navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years. The army has decided to allow them to fly helicopters this year onwards. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Interacting with students virtually in his annual \\'Parikasha Pe Charcha\\' programme, he said they sometime become over conscious regarding exams and asked them to take them as a small destination in their long lives. If external pressure is not created, then students will not feel pressure of exams and their confidence will also grow, he said. While acknowledging that one cannot be good in everything, Modi also asked students to not run away from any subject even if they find it difficult, and cited his own example of taking up more complex work in morning when he feels fresh and leaving easier parts to late night. He asked teachers to guide students and told parents to never create fear in the minds of their children, saying this may instill negativity in them.Parents should instead reinforce positive motivation, he said. Parents unwittingly at time make children \"instruments\" of fulfilling their dreams and goals, he said, advising them against this.

              " \" BBL-winning captain ready to share winning mantra with KL Rahul in IPL 2021  Australian all-rounder Moises Henriques will be seen in action for Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021. He recently led the Sydney Sixers to a title win in Big Bash League (BBL) and will look forward to do a similar thing for his skipper KL Rahul.Henriques said a successful team needs players who are ready to help their captain when required and the same was the case with him in the BBL.“Just because you're the captain, it doesn't mean you run the show. I had 10 other very good players, very good leaders out there helping me,” the Punjab Kings website quoted Henriques as saying.“And now I'll be trying to do the same for KL (Rahul), whether it be while playing or watching the game. It is about trying to make the team get better from wherever I may be,” he added.ALSO READ | ‘I’m just glad two teams went hard for me’: Maxwell explains why the ₹14.25 crore RCB contract didn't surprise himHenriques highlighted how good fielding switches the game in a team's favour in the shortest format of the game.“I think fielding is a huge part of the game that doesn't get the praise and the acknowledgement it deserves. A lot of the best teams I've played with have had really good fielding setups,” said Henriques.“If you can constantly save 5-10 runs in the field whilst the other teams are probably losing a few runs on the field everytime. If you take that half catch or the odd run-out chance, you do it multiple times in a season and it will probably get you two or three extra wins through the course of a season,” explained the 34-year-old.ALSO READ | Full list of records & milestones Hardik Pandya can achieve in IPL 2021Punjab Kings will play against Rajasthan Royals in their first game on April 12 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.(With Agency Inputs) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics moises henriques indian premier league ipl 2021 + 1 more \",\n",
              " ' Weekly tests for India’s Tokyo-bound athletes after Covid spike in SAI centres  The impact of a surge in Covid-19 cases across India is also being felt at Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres. Tokyo Olympics-bound athletes will be tested every week and training will be as per a staggered schedule, new Standard Operating Procedures of SAI says.SAI National Centre of Excellence, Bhopal reported 36 positive cases, including 24 athletes, on Wednesday. This comes a week after 30 positive cases were reported among athletes and support staff from SAI centres in Patiala and Bengaluru, both hubs for Tokyo Olympics-bound athletes. SAI says no athlete training for the Olympics has tested positive in recent days.Precautionary Covid tests are already being done in SAI centres in the wake of a rapid rise in cases. Athletes and support staff in its Bhopal centre had given the test on April 3 (Saturday) and April 6 (Tuesday). “In the two tests conducted, a total of 36 people have tested positive for Covid, out of whom 24 are athletes and the other 12 are staff of NCOE (National Centres of Excellence).“However, none of the athletes who have tested positive are Olympics-bound. Some of the athletes who tested positive had returned from competitions of wushu and judo,” SAI said in a statement.The athletes who tested positive have been shifted to hospital as a precautionary measure. “None of the athletes are critical,” it added.There will be no disruption in training, but SAI has issued a circular to all NCOEs to strictly follow the SOPs and conduct regular precautionary tests for athletes. As per the new SOP, athletes must take a RT-PCR test within 72 hours before arrival and will be allowed in the centre only if the report is negative. National campers who are Olympic probables will have to undergo a week’s quarantine, and training will be allowed with Covid-appropriate protocols.There will be weekly testing of all athletes, support staff and administration and strict quarantine norms have been put in place. “An RT-PCR test will be conducted for national campers on the 6th day of quarantine and thereafter, every week,” SAI said.“All precautions and norms will be implemented keeping Olympic probable athletes in mind so that their training does not suffer, with special schedules and staggered timings being drawn up,” SAI said.The women’s wrestling team has left SAI Centre, Lucknow for Kazakhstan to take part in the Asian Olympic Qualifiers starting on Friday. Some of those who will participate in non-Olympic categories at the Asian championships will leave in a day or two.“After Holi, most of the wrestlers went home and they were allowed to travel to Kazakhstan directly from there as calling them again to the centre would have meant they will have to be in quarantine,” SAI executive director, Sanjay Saraswat, said on Wednesday.SAI’s come-and-play scheme for the public has been shut. “We have also asked the national campers not to go outside the centre. They will be allowed to go home or travel only in emergency situations,” said Saraswat. “So far no one from the centre is corona positive.”Judo team quarantined in BishkekThe Indian judo team has withdrawn from the Asia-Oceania Championships in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan after two judokas tested positive during tests done by the organisers.The team of 19 members—15 judokas and four coaches—has been put on a 10-day quarantine as per protocol of local health authorities. The team went through two tests in India and one after reaching Kyrgyzstan and reported negative each time. They tested positive before the competition on Monday.“The players are safe in a hotel with their daily requirements being looked after,” SAI said. “The sports ministry is in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs to bring the players back safe.”The tournament was part of the Olympic qualification cycle based on world rankings.

              " ' UK to offer non-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to under-30s over blood clot link  The U.K. recommended not using AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine on those under the age of 30 after drug regulators there and in the European Union highlighted a possible link with a rare type of blood clot in the brain.The assessments follow an increasing number of reports of side effects in people who’ve received the Astra dose. Despite this, both the U.K. and EU agencies agreed that the benefits of the shot outweigh the risks.In its latest recommendation, the European Medicines Agency said that “unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects.” The U.K. is advising that those under 30 be offered an alternative to Astra if one is available.The latest assessments of the Astra vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford, comes amid increasing public wariness about the shot, with patients from Bucharest to Calais canceling scheduled appointments as they await more clarity.The warning could threaten the European Union’s vaccination campaign, which was just beginning to kick into a higher gear after a sluggish start. EU health ministers will meet this evening to discuss the path forward with AstraEMA Executive Director Emer Cooke tried to counter any public worries by pointing out that the vaccine is vital in fighting a virus that’s causing “thousands of deaths” every day. June Raine, chief executive of the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, stressed that the specific clotting side effects were very rare.“Covid-19 is a very serious disease with high hospitalization and death rates,” Cooke said at a press conference. “This vaccine has proven to be highly effective. It prevents severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives.”Also Read | AstraZeneca Covid vaccine possibly linked to rare blood clots: EU drug regulatorConcerns about the vaccine are centered on an unusual type of blood clot in the brain called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It has occurred together with low levels of blood platelets after vaccination.“These clotting disorders are very rare side effects of the vaccine,” said Sabine Strauss, the head of the EMA’s safety committee. The group hasn’t identified a “definite cause” or a patient profile that would be most at risk, according to Strauss.The EMA’s safety committee based its latest analysis on a review of 84 cases of clotting, with most to the brain area, that had been reported by March 22 -- by which point 25 million people in the U.K. and Europe had received the Astra shot.By April 4, the reported clotting instances had increased to 222 -- again, with most to the brain area -- out of 34 million people who’d received the shot. Those updated figures do not change the agency’s recommendation, it said.Generally speaking, these clots occur most commonly in women between the ages of 30 and 45, EMA officials have said, a group that in the EU has been disproportionately vaccinated with Astra’s shot.

Mohol said, “It is true that complaints are coming in, but it is also true that the numbers are busy, which means the staff is attending to some other patient’s call. I have instructed municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar to increase manpower immediately and make it like a call centre.” As the second surge is high, there is bed shortage and relatives of positive patients are constantly trying the helpline numbers for availability of beds. PMC has 10 helpline numbers for information about bed availability. Mohol said, “I am personally following up whether the staff has increased and more lines are open.” One of the employees manning the phone lines, on condition of anonymity, said, “It takes four to five minutes per call.

              " \" SC to hear pleas of Maha govt, Anil Deshmukh against HC order on Thursday  The Supreme Court will on Thursday hear the pleas filed by Maharashtra government and its former home minister Anil Deshmukh who have challenged the Bombay High Court order directing a CBI probe into the allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.As per the cause list uploaded on the apex court website, both the pleas would come up for hearing on Thursday before a bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta.In its plea filed in the top court, Maharashtra government has questioned the procedure adopted by high court saying the state was heard on question of maintainability of the pleas seeking CBI investigation against Deshmukh on allegation of corruption, and the order too was reserved on that issue, but the court finally ended up directing the probe.After the high court order on April 5, Deshmukh, a veteran politician from Vidarbha, had resigned from the state government.In his appeal filed in the apex court, Deshmukh has said the high court order raises issues of seminal importance which “impact not just the federal structure of the country, impact on our polity, but also the manner in which, and the institutions through which investigations are to be conducted”.He said that without lodging an FIR, the court could have directed that an application be filed before the magistrate for investigation under section 156(3) of the CrPC.“The fact that the court did not direct the petitioners before the court to follow this procedure suggests that the court believed that entire state machinery was untrustworthy; that no investigation could have been made within the state by a state investigating agency, and reposed faith in an outside agency by referring to it as an ‘independent investigating agency’ knowing fully well that its credentials in the past are not such that the court can repose absolute faith in such an agency,” Deshmukh said in his plea.He said that in the annals of judicial history, there has hardly been an occasion when the court has taken the statements made against a sitting minister at face value and proceeded to direct an outside agency, without calling for a response from the minister, to conduct a preliminary inquiry.“That presently, the CBI today is being headed by an interim director, the legality of which is also sub-judice before this court. This also is a factor that should have been taken into account, before the court passed the order that it did”, the plea said.He said the court must have been aware of the fact that the Maharashtra government had withdrawn its consent for the CBI to investigate matters in the territory of the state.The former minister, who has sought ex-parte stay on the high court order said, that since now he has resigned from the post, the state machinery can freely conduct its investigations, and the apprehensions expressed by the high Ccourt contained in the impugned order no longer exist.Dealing with the allegations levelled by Param Bir Singh, Deshmukh said there is not an iota of substantive evidence that is placed before the court to even prima facie establish that any of the allegations made have an element of truth and is “pure hearsay”.Singh, in his plea filed on March 25, had sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh has denied any wrongdoing.Bombay-based lawyer Jayshree Patil, on whose criminal writ petition the high court had ordered the CBI probe, had on Tuesday filed a caveat in the top court seeking to be heard before any order is passed in the matter.In its 52-page judgement, the high court said Singh's allegations against Deshmukh had put at stake the citizen's faith in the state police.Such allegations, made by a serving police officer, against the state home minister could not be left unattended, and were required to be probed into, if prima facie, they made a case of a cognisable offence, the high court said.The high court's verdict came on three PILs including one filed by Singh and a criminal writ petition filed last month, seeking several reliefs as also a CBI probe into the matter.

              " \" Spain, Netherlands plan for fans at European Championship  Spain and the Netherlands are now committing to having fans at the European Championship matches they are hosting in June.They are the latest countries to offer assurances to UEFA over the return of crowds, leaving Dublin as one of the 12 cities with the most doubts about whether spectators will be permitted during the pandemic, and at risk of being cut from the hosting.Bilbao is telling UEFA that it will guarantee the 53,000-capacity San Mames can have up to a quarter of seats filled, Spanish authorities said Wednesday.A similar number of fans should be at games in Amsterdam, with the Dutch football federation saying authorities want to allow at least 12,000 spectators who have presented a negative Covid-19 test result into the Johan Cruyff Arena.Both Bilbao and Amsterdam have three games in the group stage and a round of 16 match. Authorities in the Netherlands warn that if the coronavirus situation deteriorates, then the presence of fans in the Amsterdam stadium will have to be re-evaluated.“We look forward to welcoming 12,000 spectators to the Johan Cruyff Arena, but we are aware that the coronavirus is unpredictable and there are no guarantees,” said Gijs de Jong, a tournament director in Amsterdam. “However, we remain hopeful that, come June, the situation will have improved to the point where we can allow even more spectators to attend.”The rescheduled European Championship is due to open on June 11 in Rome after Italy said Tuesday that it is ready to let fans back into stadiums by then. Fans have been banned from matches in Italy for the majority of the past year, apart from a brief period shortly after the start of the season when up to 1,000 spectators were allowed into games.The city of Munich was less committal in its statement on Tuesday, saying it is “conceivable and desirable that spectators can be in the stadium” for its four games.There is a risk that cities could be cut from the hosting if they can’t say if crowds will be allowed by June. Those guarantees are yet to come from countries including Scotland, which is due to stage four games in Glasgow, and Ireland, which has four fixtures in Dublin.The city with the most games is London, which will stage seven fixtures at Wembley including the semifinals and final. Authorities hope the 90,000-capacity might even be full by the end of the tournament.In Scotland, no date has been set for the return of fans but provisional proposals will be submitted to UEFA this week about what is achievable at Glasgow's Hampden Park in June.Russia has already confirmed that St. Petersburg’s 65,000-seat stadium will be filled to at least 50% capacity for its four games. Denmark is planning on up to 12,000 fans being allowed into the four matches at the 38,000-capacity Parken Stadium. A similar number could be attending games in Romania under government plans for the 55,000-capacity national stadium in Bucharest to be at least a quarter filled.Baku, Azerbaijan and Budapest, Hungary are also due to be part of the hosting of the tournament that has been rearranged from 2020.

Here are the facts: Total number of COVID vaccine supplied to State till date - 1,06,19,190; Consumption - 90,53,523 (of which 6% wastage - over 5L); Vaccine in pipeline - 7,43,280.

Central Govt replenishes more vaccine than what is needed for actual use.— Prakash Javadekar (@PrakashJavdekar) April 7, 2021 \"Central Govt replenishes more vaccine than what is needed for actual use,\" he said in subsequent tweet.The Union minister\\'s comments came after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope requested the Centre to supply vaccine stocks to the state for inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries a day. He also noted that several vaccination centres across the state have been shut because of the shortage.Watch | ‘Mumbai facing Covid vaccine shortage, stock may exhaust in 2-3 days’: Mayor “The union minister Prakash Javadekar had asked us to double the vaccination numbers and had assured to provide adequate stock. We accepted it as a challenge and increased the daily vaccination to 450,000 lakh from 300,000. We will achieve the target of inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries in no time. However, we have started facing shortage of vaccine stock and have to shut down many centres across the state as there is no stock left,\" the health minister told reporters.Earlier in the day, Mumbai city mayor Kishori Pednekar also raised similar concerns about shortage of vaccines in the city. “There is a shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses in Mumbai. Yesterday, we had 1,76,000 vaccine doses but in the coming days, we will require more vaccines,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said that the allegations about shortage in vaccine supply are “utterly baseless”. In a strongly worded statement, Vardhan said, “I have seen statements made by public representatives in Maharashtra about shortage of vaccines. This is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government’s repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic. The inability of Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension.

              " ' Pakistan issues visas to over 1,100 Indian pilgrims  Pakistan has issued visas to more than 1,100 Indian Sikh pilgrims to participate in the annual Baisakhi celebrations during April 12-22. The visas were issued as a special gesture by the Pakistan government in “view of the importance of Baisakhi for Punjabis and Sikhs marking the start of their new year”, the Pakistan high commission said on Wednesday.The move comes amid a perceived thaw in bilateral relations about the time that Indian and Pakistani militaries began adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir in February. The Pakistan government recently deferred a move to import cotton and sugar from India in order to control prices and overcome a domestic shortage after facing opposition from some federal ministers. The Pakistan high commission extended special felicitations to those celebrating Baisakhi and hoped the visiting pilgrims would have a “fulfilling yatra”.Under the framework of the India-Pakistan Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines of 1974, a large number of Sikh pilgrims from India visit Pakistan to observe various religious festivals and occasions every year. The issuance of pilgrimage visas is part of the Pakistan government’s efforts for facilitating visits to religious shrines, the high commission said. “This also reflects the commitment of the government of Pakistan to faithfully implement the bilateral Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines,” it said.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has long downplayed the risks of the coronavirus and remains fully against lockdowns as too damaging to the economy.“My performance starts at the Brazilian embassy in Berlin at midnight every night. I dress myself as ... death,\" said Puetter. “I think the president is promoting deadly health policies and I think death’s the symbol of this government in many ways.”He then walks to the Brandenburg Gate and the nearby German parliament, in front of which he counts out one sunflower seed to represent each of the people who have died in Brazil over the previous 24 hours and puts them into a glass. He aims eventually to plant the seeds as a memorial.“I wanted to create a clear image of what’s going on in Brazil,\" said Puetter, who wore a black hood and cape with the words “SOS Brasil” on the back, a skull mask and a sash in Brazil\\'s green-and-yellow colors.Brazil has confirmed more than 13.1 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and nearly 337,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The charges stemmed from a World Anti-Doping Agency investigation into Russian doping in 2016.Silnov won gold in the high jump at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and Antyukh won the title in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2012 London Games. She also won bronze in the 400 and silver in the 4x400 relay in 2004. They will keep their Olympic medals.Neither athlete has competed since 2016, but Silnov was the senior vice president of the Russian track federation until June 2019, when he stepped down citing an investigation by the Athletics Integrity Unit into his conduct.CAS did not immediately say when the verdicts were handed down or give details on the cases. They were published in a brief summary of various cases and appeals concerning 12 Russians.Yelena Soboleva, who won a world indoor championship silver medal in 2006, was banned for eight years and hammer thrower Oksana Kondratyeva, who was disqualified from fifth place at the 2013 world championships, was banned for four years.CAS also reduced the length of bans for four Russians, including high jumper Ivan Ukhov. His ban was cut from four years to two years, nine months. The ruling does not reverse an earlier decision in a doping case to strip Ukhov of the 2012 Olympic high jump gold.

However, the health agency reiterated that the benefits of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine in preventing the disease outweigh the overall risk.

And on top of that, it was also recently announced that she will be joining Prabhas and Saif Ali Khan in AdipurushEven though Covid cases continue to rise, the film industry has got back on it’s feet, and been making announcements for new films. Shoots are going on in full swing. A lot of films made their way onto OTT platforms. Sanon says she would prefer theatrical releases for all her films. “Obviously, as an actor you want the film to reach more number of audiences, and beyond just the audience of OTT. Of course, they are great platforms, and everyone is hooked on to it, they have got great content. As an actor you want it to reach the masses, even the ones who don’t really go on these platforms,” says the 30-year-old, whose film Mimi, in which she plays a surrogate mother, is also waiting for a release.It’s been some time the film was announced and has been shot. Ask what’s happening on that front, and Sanon says she recently wrapped up work on the last son. “Mimi as a film needs to reach the masses. It is based on surrogacy, it’s a unique subject and made in a very entertaining manner. It is something that will touch your heart, make you cry, laugh, and leave you with food for thought. It should be watched by more people who are rooted in areas where OTT isn’t watched,” she says.In fact, it was raining release dates until now in Bollywood, which is why the actor is more than keen that her film also gets one soon. “We are very excited for Mimi to release. The times we are in, it’s important for a film like that to get a release. I am hoping things normalize soon. There are so many films pending to release in general.

              " ' Giving powers to housing society heads to tackle Covid gets mixed response in Pune  Pune: The state government’s decision to give temporary powers to the chairpersons and secretaries of housing societies to allow them to ensure that Covid patients are quarantined in their homes and do not leave the societies, has come in for some criticism. State urban development minister Eknath Shinde, at a meeting on Tuesday, directed divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and chief executive officers of nagar panchayats and municipal councils, to implement the government order strictly, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Bombay Police Act. However, society members allege that the temporary powers could be used to settle scores with opponents and impose unilateral decisions leading to internal fighting. A section of the housing society office-bearers, however, have supported the move and said it would curb the surge in Covid-19 cases. Dhananjay Patil, an resident of Kalpvriksha Housing Society in Narhe, said, “There is no society in the city where there is no clash between society residents and office-bearers. We have seen that in otherwise normal situations, there is always a game of one-upmanship between society members and office-bearers. This power might be misused by society office-bearers and hence, the decision must be rescinded.” Sanjay Sharma, secretary, Tulips and Turnips Society in Yerawada, said, “The decision to empower the chairperson and secretary to keep Covid-19 patients indoors is welcome. It will ensure that residents don’t break the law and follow the health protocols, as it is in the interest of society.” Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) director Sanjeev Kumar Patil said, “Currently, the residents need to be disciplined as they are violating the protocols and guidelines with impunity.” BJP state vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “This decision to designate the society chairperson and secretary as special police officers will trigger internal conflicts. Every society member is doing his/her level best to mitigate the crisis. Decisions like this will create tensions and spread misunderstanding in the societies. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is shirking away from its responsibility by taking such type of decisions.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The commission said that Banerjee violated the provisions of model code of conduct with her remark.The remarks were made by the chief minister at Tarakeshwar in Hooghly district. She is contesting the elections from Nandigram.Also Watch: ‘PM Modi will also sell the country soon’, says Mamata The ECI has given Banerjee 48 hours to explain her stand, failing which it will take a decision. The EC notice came on a complaint from a BJP delegation led by Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.Speaking at the rally, Banerjee urged the Muslim voters to not vote for the BJP.\"I am requesting my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands; don’t divide the minority votes after listening to the devil (Shaitaan) person who had taken money from the BJP. He passes many communal statements and initiate clashes between the Hindu and the Muslims. He is one of the apostles of the BJP, a BJP comrade. The comrades of CPM and BJP is roaming around with the money given by BJP to divide the minority-votes,\" said Banerjee. The remarks have been highlighted by the ECI in its notice.Also Read: BJP internal assessment - Nandigram a contestPrime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at the West Bengal chief minister saying these reflect the fears that minority votes are slipping out of her hands.\"Didi recently asked all Muslims to vote en bloc for her. It shows that the Muslim vote bank is slipping out of her hands. Had we said the same thing that all Hindus should unite, everybody would have criticised us. The EC would have sent us notices. We would have been censured,\" he said while addressing a rally in north Bengal on Tuesday.“This proves that the people you had relied upon to win the elections have abandoned you and you are now publicly urging Muslims to unite and vote for you and save you,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also claimed that Banerjee has hurt Bengalis\\' self-esteem by stating that people are lured to his rallies with money.Of the total 294 constituencies in the state, 125 have a significant Muslim population.According to the last Census, Muslims account for 27% of the state’s population. The community has traditionally voted for the Left and switched to the TMC in the last few elections. In the 2016 assembly polls, TMC, which won 211 of the 294 seats, won 90 seats in Muslim-dominated constituencies.Polling has been held in three of the eight phases in West Bengal Assembly elections.

              " ' The gulf between Delhi and Moscow  Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, have reiterated their commitment to the bilateral relationship. But beneath the story of cordiality is a story of increasing differences on two key issues, visible during the joint press conference of the two ministers on Tuesday.The first is on the wider relationship with the United States (US) and China. Moscow sees Washington as a belligerent actor out to contain Russian influence and punish it through sanctions. This has pushed it towards Beijing, though Mr Lavrov emphasised, in response to a question from this newspaper, that a military alliance with China was not on the cards. New Delhi sees its partnership with Washington as an important security pillar, and views Beijing as the core problem. India, thus, has chosen to remain more aligned with the US — while keeping up its independent relationship with Russia, especially on defence. Till the US and Russia achieve a degree of rapprochement or Russia and China fall out, none of which are imminent, India will have keep striking this difficult balance.On Afghanistan, Mr Lavrov was unequivocal that the Taliban had to be a part of any sustainable peace process and power-sharing compact. India has reconciled itself to the changed dynamic — but New Delhi is approaching the peace process with its eyes open, sceptical of the possibility of any inclusive political settlement, and aware that neither the Taliban nor its patron across the Durand border, Pakistan (which Mr Lavrov is now visiting, clubbed with his trip to India, a first for Russia ) is about to change its stripes. India and Russia are talking frankly, but the “time-tested relationship” is clearly headed for greater challenges. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' In new India, leveraging the country’s great mineral potential  Among the most important sectors with an impact on economic growth is mineral mining. In terms of generating employment, the sector, second only to agriculture, directly and indirectly employs about 11 million people, and sustains the livelihood of about 55 million people.Despite its huge potential, India’s mineral mining sector remained choked under previous regimes. India had been underexplored — over 17% of the nation’s land area has mineral reserves whereas mining is being carried out only on 0.25% of the area. The sector had also underperformed in attracting investments. While mineral production stands at ₹1.25 lakh crore annually, its import is a whopping ₹2.5 lakh crore.But given the importance of the sector, the Narendra Modi government has envisioned increasing the sector’s contribution from 1.75% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) currently to 2.5% of GDP. My ministry’s most important task, therefore, has been reforming this sector, with the aim of increasing the mineral production output by 200% over the next seven years. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021 is a step towards achieving this.A large number of mining blocks were not brought into production for many years. Most have been blocked in legacy cases. Such cases can neither be granted lease because the time period to grant them is already over, nor can they be brought to auction because of the legal impasse. We have amended the existing provision for reallocation of such mineral blocks through a transparent auction mechanism. Auctioned mines not made operational within three years will be returned to states concerned for reallocation through auction, as will greenfield mines allocated to public sector units that are not brought into production after a review.One of the key reforms is transferring all valid rights, approvals, clearances and licenses to the new lessee, valid until the mineral reserves last. This would facilitate lessees to transfer the mine to another entity, thus bringing in fresh investment and entrepreneurship to operate the mine.Since 2015, geological reports for 143 mineral blocks have been handed over to various states. These blocks are auction-ready, but so far, states have only auctioned seven blocks. To ensure that national reserves are put to best use, a provision has been made wherein the Union government can conduct auctions in consultation where states face challenges or fail to conduct auctions.Removing the distinction between captive and non-captive mines was long in coming. We knew it was akin to participating in a race with one leg tied. With no such distinction now, there will be a level-playing field for mineral block auctions. Existing captive mines have also been allowed to sell minerals over and above their requirements. A 50% rebate in the revenue share, for the quantity of minerals produced and dispatched earlier than scheduled date of production, has also been provided.This amendment Act is set to redefine the standard of exploration required for auctioning of partially explored mineral blocks for prospecting licence-cum-mining lease. This will boost seamless transition from exploration to production and encourage the participation of private players. The amended provisions in the Act also ensure better clarity on “Mining without Lawful Authority” to save lease-holders from unjustified penalties under other litigations.We have also fulfilled a long-standing demand by making local Members of Parliament members of the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) governing council to make DMF more outcome-oriented. Arrangements have also been made to keep a check on misuse of DMF funds so that inclusive development of those affected by mining can be ensured. There are several other changes in the MMDR Act that will boost the ease of doing business in the mineral mining sector, make it more competitive, pave the way for creation of employment opportunities, and have a multiplier effect on several other sectors. Over several meetings, PM Modi laid out a plan where the sector takes allied industries on a growth course to help India become a $5-trillion economy. These amendments are in line with his vision, and the sector will play a major role in defining a New India.Pralhad Joshi is Union minister of coal, mines and parliamentary affairsThe views expressed are personal SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Visualising tech education of the future  Project 2061 was a long-term project initiated in 1985 to reform education in science, technology and math. The name was inspired by Comet Halley, which happened to be in the earth’s vicinity in 1985. It is said that the project director often joked that it would take that long (76 years) to turn the massive ship of education around because of the tremendous inertia in the system.Fast forward to 2021. We know the writing on the wall — technology is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, organisations that are thriving are the ones quickest to adapt and so on. But here is the question — has our tech education kept pace with this change? Are we preparing Gen Z to shape this future, responsibly?We need to hit refresh on our tech education, now. Here are three areas which need a refresh.First, disciplines of the future.Standalone engineering departments are steeped in history. Civil engineering is among the oldest formal engineering disciplines and reflects the start of construction of roads, bridges and cities. Mechanical and chemical engineering emerged in their current form around the Industrial Revolution. Computer engineering came later. The next century is being defined by the advent of new technologies. The car of yesteryears was primarily a mechanical device, but the car of the future will be electric, autonomous and connected.The future of education will be interdisciplinary. The siloed degrees of the past need to give way to interdisciplinary programmes. For example, robotics and cyber-physical systems will shape the factories of the future. Future health care will be at the intersection of biosciences, computing and engineering. It is time for us to embrace cutting-edge interdisciplinary programmes in mainstream education.Why is this important? This brings us to the second area — solving grand challenges.We are faced with perceptible grand challenges every day — unclean air, cyber insecurity, global pandemics and more. These challenges affect the world at large and are even more pertinent to India. The raison d’être of engineers has been to create solutions for people. However, engineers identify themselves not by solutions, but by narrow disciplinary toolkits which risk irrelevance over time.What if every researcher and student identified themselves less with a discipline (“I am an X engineer”) and more with a problem? For example — “I am working on affordable and clean energy access for every person” or “I am working on making our cyberspace safe”. What if each of the 1.2 million engineers graduating every year in India took on a real problem for industry or society?That mindset to solve problems, supported by a multidisciplinary education combining advanced technology with its estranged cousins — humanities, design and business — can catalyse the emergence of solutions. The ancient Takshashila University, which was home to some of the greatest Indian scholars such as Panini, Charaka and Chanakya, was multidisciplinary.What kind of students would lead this change? And that is the third area of focus — identifying future tech leaders.We need tech leaders who are not only intellectually strong, but also passionate, creative, entrepreneurial and socially conscious. However, if our higher education institutions anchor disproportionately on test-oriented intelligence, our high school students will learn to view their self-worth through the same lens. Tech universities of the future need to have holistic selections to signal that they value not only intellectual quotient, but are also interested in what drives a student, what the student has built, what the student wants to solve. This will have a great impact on adolescent life by replacing pressure with more purpose and joy.This brings us to the final point — whose responsibility is it to execute this? Building high quality universities was once seen as the prerogative of either the government or a few select philanthropists. Open architecture has shown a way for diverse people anywhere to be able to contribute to a mission. This idea is making its way into how greenfield universities are being set up in India and existing institutions are evolving.A wide variety of people can make meaningful contributions to the mission — scientists and educators can help students imbibe a research mindset early on, industry can provide relevant problems to work on, entrepreneurs can show students how to make solutions viable, existing premier institutions can share intellectual strength with new-age institutions, philanthropists globally can contribute funds towards the mission.It is said that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. We need all hands on deck to invent the future we want to wake up to, without waiting for the next sighting of Comet Halley to get our act together.Neeraj Aggarwal is chairman-Asia Pacific, Boston Consulting Group, and founder and trustee of the upcoming Plaksha University.

              " ' In a first, UP to transform five jails into high-security prisons by 2023  Under the pilot project, govt starts the process in dist jails of Lucknow, GB Nagar, Azamgarh, Chitrakoot besides Bareilly central prison In a first-ever move, Uttar Pradesh has started a process for transforming five of its jails into maximum security prisons. Under the pilot initiative, the district jails of Lucknow, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Azamgarh and Chitrakoot besides the central prison at Bareilly are being equipped with high-end gadgets for better security and surveillance, say state home department officials. “The work has started in earnest and we expect the five prisons to get fully ready in around two years’ time,” says additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi. “The plan is not just to arm the prisons with high-tech equipment, including a network of CCTV cameras with a central control room, but also to impart special training to jail staff to handle new-age equipment and also arm them with modern weapons needed to undertake their responsibilities effectively,” he added. Some of the equipment being installed in these prisons include non-linear junction detectors (used for detecting hidden electronic items like smart phones etc) besides dual-view baggage scanners, x-ray based full human body scanners, drone cameras to high-end hand-held metal detectors among others. After taking over, CM Yogi Adityanath in 2017 had initiated an exercise to equip prisons in the state with improved mobile phone jammers having proper power back-ups, CCTV cameras and metal detectors to check the activities of criminals who operate their gangs and execute crimes from behind the bars. The decision to transform the five prisons into high-security jails is in line with this very initiative, say the officials privy to the development. For this purpose, the state government has recently sanctioned ₹20.35 crore. In follow-up, UP prison administration and reforms department has already floated e-tenders for procuring dual-view baggage scanners and x-ray based full human body scanners that are to be procured at a cost of around over ₹6.5 crore. “For the staff of these jails also, night vision binoculars and body worn cameras are being procured,” said an official aware of the development. “In these jails, the state government also plans to put up concertina wire fencing (specially designed spiral wire, broadly used for fencing purposes) as well as construct meeting rooms having contactless glass akin to those in prisons in developed countries so as to prevent physical contact with visitors and chances of their passing on a banned item to an inmate,” the official added. “These prisons will also have effective and reliable intercom system, state-of-the-art firefighting capabilities like water mist and CFR fighting systems as well as adequate capacity to stop illegal and banned items from entering the prisons and their search by use of metal detectors and even deep search metal detectors that can detect items buried underground and in walls,” he added. UP jails The state has 71 prisons of various levels, including five central jails at Naini (Prayagraj), Varanasi, Fatehgarh, Bareilly and Agra, and three special jails at Lucknow and Bareilly besides a Nari Bandi Niketan. The total capacity of these prisons is around 60,685 inmates but according to the website of the prison administration and reforms, over 1.08 lakh inmates, including 27,127 convicts and 81,116 undertrials, were lodged in UP jails as on January 31, 2021. They include 323 foreigners as well. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' UK to brief on AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as safety concerns grow  The U.K.’s drug regulator will address safety concerns surrounding AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, as fears grow that the government’s inoculation targets will be put at risk.Representatives from the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the government’s vaccine committee will speak at 3 p.m., at the same time as the European Medicines Agency holds its own press briefing.They will update on their investigations into potential links between the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed with Oxford University, and rare cases of brain blood clots in adults. On Tuesday, a trial of the Astra vaccine among children was paused to await the findings of the U.K. review.It comes as a vaccine by Moderna Inc. began to be rolled out in the U.K. for the first time, the third approved coronavirus shot alongside those from Astra and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. The U.K. has ordered 17 million doses of Moderna’s two-shot vaccine, enough for 8.5 million people.The success of the vaccine program is crucial to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ambition to fully reopen the U.K. economy on June 21. The U.K. has ordered 100 million doses of the Astra vaccine, and 40 million doses of Pfizer.TargetsConcerns are growing that a setback with the Astra shot could mean the U.K. misses its target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July, although the government insists it remains on track.The pound extended losses ahead of the briefing, hitting its weakest level against the euro in a month.U.K. ministers have repeatedly said the benefits of the vaccine in preventing coronavirus far outweigh any risks.‘No Proof’“There is no proof as yet that there is any causal links on the very, very rare occasions that there have been talks about blood clots,” Business Minister Paul Scully told Sky News on Wednesday. “The AstraZeneca vaccine is safe; it has saved thousands of lives.”But some scientists have urged caution while investigations are carried out. Maggie Wearmouth, a member of the U.K.’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, suggested that “perhaps slowing things down” might be wise.Speaking in a personal capacity, she told the Daily Telegraph: “The issue is about safety and public confidence. We don’t want to cover anything up that we feel that the public should be knowing.”Adam Finn from the University of Bristol, also a member of the JCVI, said it was possible that Moderna or other vaccines could be reserved for younger groups in case Astra’s use was restricted.‘On Track’Vaccination centers and pharmacies are facing a “significant reduction” in supply of doses during April, meaning that older people waiting for second doses will be prioritized over younger people getting their first shot.The pace of the rollout across England is now estimated at an average of 2.7 million doses a week until the end of July -- “considerably slower” than a previous forecast of 3.2 million a week, according to a modeling paper from scientists on a government advisory committee.“There will be a slight reduction in April, but the key thing to remember is that that doesn’t mean that we’re not on track to meet our pledges,” said Johnson’s official spokesman Jamie Davies.The U.K. remains “on track” to offer a first dose to all over-50s by April 15, and to all adults by the end of July, he added.Johnson Faces Political Fight Over U.K. Covid Passports PlanThree in five adults in the U.K. have been vaccinated so far and the most recent government data shows that more than 31.6 million people have received a first dose, and 5.5 million have had a second dose.On a visit on Tuesday to an Astra manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, northwest England, Johnson urged people to keep getting their shots: “keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics covid-19 astrazeneca ',\n",
              " ' Centre opens up Covid-19 vaccination at work places from April 11  The Centre has written to states to launch Covid-19 vaccinations at workplaces from Sunday, April 11, provided there is an availability of at least 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries.“…in order to increase the access of the vaccine to these populations, Covid-19 vaccination sessions may be organized at work places (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these work places with an existing Covid vaccination centre (CVC). .. Please initiate due consultations with public and private sector employers and management to prepare for launch of work place vaccination. Such work place vaccination centres may be launched across states and UTs from April 11, 2021,” wrote Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, to all state chief secretaries and principal secretary (health).The idea behind the move is to rapidly cover the eligible beneficiaries who are prone to getting severe Covid-19, and also to make it convenient for working professionals to access the vaccination. It will also ensure that people do not need to travel to get vaccinated, therefore, avoiding the risk of contracting the viral infection.“A substantial proportion of population aged 45 years and above are in the organized sector of the economy, and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private)…” the letter further read.The threshold of 100 minimum eligible beneficiaries has been set to have optimal vaccine utilization, and to avoid wastage as far as possible.It will be the responsibility of the district task force— chaired by district magistrate— and urban task force— chaired by municipal commissioner— to identify government and private workplaces after due deliberation with relevant employers and head of offices.The office management will designate an employee as a nodal officer to oversee and facilitate all aspects of the vaccination process in office.

              " ' In state elections, decoding the PM’s campaign and his key messages  By addressing over two dozen rallies spread across four states — West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala — and the Union territory of Puducherry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave an impetus to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s election campaign and showed yet again why he remains the party’s most important political campaigner, irrespective of the nature of the polls. Since the elections were announced, spread over eight phases in West Bengal, three in Assam and a single phase in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry — only five phases in Bengal remain while the rest concluded on April 6 — the PM addressed 25 rallies as per the data collated by his office. Out of this, the PM has addressed 11 rallies in Bengal, seven in Assam; and three each in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and one in Puducherry. But it was not just the number of rallies: in each speech, the PM made significant pointers which revealed both his political worldview, the party’s strategy, governance achievements, and an attack on political rivals. Here is the main thrust of his messages. West Bengal - 11 ralliesThe PM’s first official election rally in the state, where the BJP is locked in a tight contest with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), was in Kolkata’s Brigade Ground on March 7. This was followed by public addresses on March 18 in Purulia; on March 20 in Kharagpur; and on March 2 in Bankura. On March 24, the PM’s schedule included a rally in Kanthi followed by two more addresses in Uluberia and Jayanagar; on April 3, the PM addressed two meetings in Tarkeshwar and Sonarpur. On April 6, he was back in Cooch Behar and Howrah. His speeches have focused largely on the lack of development in the state, political violence and corruption. In sharp, calibrated attacks, the PM has kept the focus on corruption and the leakages in the public distribution system. “Where there is a scheme, there’s a scam,” — with statements such as these, the PM has not only lashed out at the TMC, but also posited the BJP as the alternative that has promised a sonar bangla or golden Bengal. “Asol Parivartan” or the real change has also been the PM’s key promise to the people of Bengal. On Tuesday, for instance, while speaking at a rally in Cooch Behar, PM Modi who has been calling for a poriborton or change, coined another slogan Chalo Paltai (let us bring about the change) to target CM Mamata Banerjee.Also Read | BJP internal assessment: Nandigram a contestWith the Opposition accusing the BJP of stoking communal polarisation in the state and turning the Jai Shri Ram slogan into a war cry, the PM retorted that had the BJP, like Banerjee, appealed for votes on the basis of religion, then it would have to face the music from the election commission as well as the media. At the same time, his speeches have been laced with critical references to “appeasement”, which is code for what the BJP alleges to be the pro-Muslim tilt of Mamata Banerjee’s government. In his speeches, the PM has also targeted the CM for not allowing the benefits of Central schemes such as the PM KIsan Nidhi from reaching beneficiaries. In multiple speeches, he has alleged that women, backward classes, farmers and tea garden workers have been deprived of social welfare schemes. The Opposition has dismissed the PM’s campaign. “I don’t think there will be much impact of his campaigning . People were curious about the PM and came to see him initially. But yesterday, he addressed a meeting in a rural area and it wasn’t packed. He is trying his best to polarise. But I feel it is having diminishing returns,’’said TMC MP Saugata RoyTamil Nadu -3 ralliesIn Tamil Nadu, where the BJP is contesting the election as an ally of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the Prime Minister addressed three rallies — on March 30 in Dharapuram and on April 2 in Madurai and Kanyakumari — with an aim of both showing the BJP’s respect for Tamil Nadu’s distinct culture and traditions and highlighting governance achievements. The PM largely spoke about how Central government schemes were beneficial for the people of Tamil Nadu. He also, repeatedly, invoked former chief ministers MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalitha, and accused the Congress of disrespecting democracy. The BJP in Tamil Nadu used the Vetrivel Yatra, designed to cover the six abodes of Lord Murugan in the state, as an attempt to cultivate its image as that of a party trying to revive Tamil pride, and the PM, while referring to the Central schemes and their benefits, said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is inspired by the great Andal and Avvaiyar. It was, once again, in line with the deference shown to local culture and tradition that the PM brought up the United Progressive Alliance government’s stance on banning Jallikattu and how it was the NDA that cleared the ordinance brought by AIADMK, allowing Jallikattu to take place again. Also Read | TN polls: Clad in PPE kit, Covid-19 positive Kanimozhi cast vote in ChennaiAttacks against dynastic politics, as represented by both the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress, were part of the PM’s speeches. “NDA agenda is development agenda while Congress and DMK have only dynasty agenda. They only demean others and spread lies,” he said. Economic revival and an impetus to production, especially in the MSME sector, was also a highlight of the speeches.The Opposition, however, has accused the PM of being anti-Tamil. “It has become comical that every time Modi comes to Tamil Nadu, he starts quoting (Tamil saint) Thiruvalluvar and Avvaiyar but he’s against Tamils and the party is imposing Hindi on us,” says DMK MP and party spokesperson TKS Elangovan. “In Dharapuram, Modi made false statements that DMK treats women badly and he didn’t speak a word about the sex scandal in Pollachi (where two AIADMK functionaries were arrested and expelled from the party). Modi gives false information and his promise to make Tamil Nadu into Uttar Pradesh is dangerous and nobody will like that.”Kerala -3 ralliesIn Kerala where the BJP has a lone legislator in the assembly, the party has been trying to establish its footprint. Here, the PM addressed three rallies — in Palakkad on March 30, followed by two more in Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthitta on April 2. The PM sharply criticised both the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Congress-led United Democratic Front, referring to them as twins in “misgovernance, corruption, casteism and nepotism” and accused them of committing “seven deadly sins”, which included “false sense of pride and arrogance, greed for money, wrath towards people, jealousy towards each other, lust for power, dynasty politics and laziness in work”. Also Read | Post-poll violence rocks Kerala, Muslim League worker stabbed to death in KannurThe Sabarimala issue that has emerged as a key poll issue found a mention in the PM’s speeches. In Konni, the epicentre of the Sabarimala agitation, he hit out at the LDF government for taking action against Ayyappa devotees during the agitation to prevent women of all age groups from visiting the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. The issues of disaster management and water availability in Kerala and economic revival were also part of the speeches where the election concluded on Tuesday. He listed some of the key projects that the Centre has sanctioned for Kerala in the recent Budget, including ₹65,000 crore for roads and highways as part of the Mumbai-Kanyakumari economic corridor, the second phase of the Kochi Metro and a plan for a fishing harbour in Kochi. The Opposition was critical. “The PM thinks about Sabarimala and Lord Ayyappa when he is in Kerala. During the last parliament election, he said that the Union government will protect interests of devotees. Two years have passed and nothing has been done. He is raking it up again eyeing votes. But devotees can’t be taken for a ride”, said Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala, also the state Opposition leader. Assam -7 ralliesIn Assam, where the BJP is pitted against the coalition of 10 parties including the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the issue of illegal immigrants and protection of Assamese traditions and culture has been high on the party’s agenda. Here, the PM addressed three rallies starting with Karimganj on March 18 followed by Chabua and Bokakhat on March 20 and 21. Bihpuria and Sipajhar were the next destinations for his rallies on March 23 and 24 and these were followed by a rally each in Kokjrajhar and Tamulpur on April 1 and 3. The PM’s speeches targeted the Mahajot or the Opposition’s alliance and referred to it as “Mahajhoot” or grand lies. Making a reference to the Assamese identity, he said people would not tolerate those who insult Assam’s pride and identity. The BJP alleges that the AIUDF is sympathetic towards illegal immigrants. Also Read | BJP to retain Assam, high voting signals pro-incumbency: Jitendra SinghWhile the BJP faced a lot of criticism following discrepancies in the National Register of Citizens and following the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the PM chose to stress on the party’s inclusive politics. In the state with a 30% Muslim population, the PM said it is the country’s misfortune that working for a particular section is called secularism while working for everyone gets you called communal. He attacked the Congress for failing to curb the culture of violence, bombs, and gun in the state during its rule and said the NDA government is moving forward on the path of peace and prosperity with every partner of Assam. The Opposition attacked the PM. “We have seen how low politics has stooped low in this election in Assam. The kind of statements made by the Prime Minister and Union home minister during their campaign goes against Assam’s history, identity and culture. They have done a negative campaign and there was nothing positive for Assam in their campaign,” said Congress in-charge for Assam, Jitendra Singh. Puducherry - 1 rallyThe PM held a rally on March 30 in Puducherry, where the Congress government fell a few weeks before the election was announced. In his address, the PM attacked the Congress for failing to provide governance, ensure the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and curbing corruption. Also Read | Puducherry records 81.70% turnout in assembly pollsHe also took potshots at the former chief minister V Narayanasamy who was not given a ticket to contest the polls. “The situation in Puducherry is unique… It reflects the condition of the Congress. He was denied a ticket despite being a loyalist for so many years” the PM said. The denial of ticket to the former CM was attributed as an example of the failure to govern. The PM assured voters of infrastructure development, job creation and a fillip to tourism if the BJP is elected. (With inputs by Umar Sofi) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Indian Navy to seek green light for expansion of nuke, diesel submarine fleet  The Indian Navy intends to approach the government for authorised force levels of nuclear-powered and diesel-electric attack submarines in addition to the ballistic missile submarines with Strategic Force Command (SFC), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The navy’s new plan, inspired by a similar cabinet authorisation for 42 squadrons of the Indian Air Force, will seek approvals for 6 nuclear-powered attack submarines and 18 diesel attack submarines, a South Block official said. The authorisation for the diesel subs would include those with an air-independent propulsion system, or AIP, which ensures these submarines can remain under surface for a longer period and are quieter than the nuclear-powered submarine.The proposed move comes at a time the navy is finalising plans to seek approval from the Defence Acquisition Committee to build six nuclear-powered attack submarines, or SSNs, as part of the defence establishment’s continuing focus on expanding the navy’s capabilities to counter the rise of China’s navy in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond.India currently has only one Akula class SSN on lease from Russia, Akula-II nuclear-powered attack boat INS Chakra, and 15 diesel-electric submarines including the Scorpene-class submarine INS Kalvari. While three of the Kalvari class submarines have been commissioned, the remaining three will be fitted with the AIP system that makes the submarine more lethal than SSNs because its low radar signature minimizes the possibility of detection.The SSNs play a huge role in sea denial to the adversary and have the capability to remain under the sea without surfacing except for replenishing food stocks and other logistics.The Indian Strategic Forces Command, which is part of the Nuclear Command Authority and is responsible for the management of the country’s strategic nuclear weapons stockpile, has one 6,000 tonnes nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arihant. The next SSBN, INS Arighat, is set to be commissioned in 2022, the 75th year of Independence and will have K-15 and K-4 nuclear-capable submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missiles on board. The K-15 is expected to have a range of up to 1,500 km while the K-4 is likely to have a maximum range of 3,500 km.Both missiles are being developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, or DRDO.The DRDO also has long-term plans to develop and test-fire the K5 missile, which will have a range of 5,000 km, the same range as the Agni-5 surface-to-surface missile.The SSBN is the most potent of the nuclear triad due to its survival capabilities and forms the backbone of India’s second-strike capability due to its no-first-use (NFU) policy as spelt out in the draft nuclear doctrine.India’s strategic ally France is willing to jointly design and develop SSNs with India, a partnership that will assume importance when Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to Paris to hold a bilateral summit with President Emmanuel Macron after the completion of the India-EU summit at Lisbon on May 8. The French SSNs are based in Toulon in southern France, and its ballistic missiles submarines in the port city of Brest in northwestern France.India’s national security establishment is already in touch with its French counterparts to ensure that the Indian Navy builds up enough deterrence in the Indo-Pacific in the face of the rapidly expanding PLA Navy. The Indian Navy expects the PLA Navy to start sending carrier strike force patrols to the Indian Ocean by 2023. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics indian navy india china border tensions ',\n",

              " ' Rise in testing count delays RT-PCR reports by up to 36 hours leading to possible spread of infection in Pune  Pune: Medical labs are seeing a rise in people seeking Covid tests following new restrictions in place which makes it mandatory for workers to get a negative RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) report. The huge demand for tests is causing delay in furnishing reports which in some cases is almost 36 hours. While it may not lead to any delay in treatment of critical patients, it delays isolation of Covid positives and asymptomatic patients continuing to spread the infection in the community, according to public health experts. As of March 30, Pune has 36 RT-PCR and 56 RAT (rapid antigen test) laboratories in the district. As per the presentation by the district collector to the chief secretary, government of Maharashtra, the district has conducted 2,839,453 tests, of which 519,600 are positive which takes the positivity rate to 18.3%. Of this RT-PCR has a positivity rate of 19.29% and RAT of 16.73%. The collector in the presentation had highlighted that RT-PCR test capacity for the district needs to be increased as National Institute of Virology (NIV) and other central government labs has reduced their RT-PCR testing for district. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recently made it mandatory for those in essential services to either get vaccinated or submit a negative RT-PCR report every 15 days. Pallavi Jain, managing director, Krsnaa Diagnostics Ltd, said, “The new restrictions in place in Pune and also the surge in Covid cases are definitely leading to more demand for testing in the city. Since the sample is collected it takes between 18 and 24 hours. Also, we have been strictly asked by the administration to first provide information, including address in case of positive report, to them before sharing it with the patients. Hence, it takes another six hours. In case of critical patients, we alert the hospital. However, until the SMS is not sent through and the detailed address is not in, the sample testing is put on hold which further delays it. Shortage of staff and the cost capping by the government has further added to the delay.” Another private city hospital lab manager said, “We have prioritised home sample collection of those bed ridden or critical patients who cannot visit us. We mostly request suspected patients to visit our nearest branch and submit the samples. We have advance booking for two days for home collection for samples and the reports come in by at least 36 hours. We have 2,200-2,300 samples pending for testing.” Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospitals, said, “There is definitely a delay in submitting reports. In case of critical patients based on the HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) we decide the treatment line without awaiting the report. However, in case of asymptomatic or those with mild symptoms, if the results come in late then they continue to spread the infection and the chain of infection continues to grow.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Madhubani massacre case main accused arrested, links with BJP MLA alleged  Bihar police on Wednesday arrested the main accused in the Benni Patti massacre case, in which five upper-caste Rajput men, including a BSF officer, were gunned down at Mahmudpur village under Benipatti police station in Bihar’s Madhubani district on March 29. The main accused, Pravin Jha, is suspected to be the force behind a newly-formed private army named ‘Ravan Sena’, made up of upper caste ‘Maithil Brahmins’ in the region.Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has alleged that Jha has links with former minister and BJP MLA from Benipatti, Binod Narayan Jha. “The BJP MLA has close links with Pravin Jha. The family of the deceased, locals have all vouched for it. Police should look into the call details of the BJP MLA and a fair investigation should be conducted,” Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, leader of the opposition, said in Patna on Wednesday.However, the BJP MLA has denied any link in a video message in circulation on social media.On the day of Holi, more than 50 armed men opened fire on members of Ranvijay Singh’s family, which was involved in a dispute between Muhammadpur and Gebipur villages over fishing from a pond. In the gang war like attack, Ranvijay Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members -- Rana Pratap Singh (a BSF officer), Amrendra Singh (a cricketer) and Rudra Narayan Singh succumbed to their injuries a day later. Another injured person, Manoj Singh, was currently admitted to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.Family members of the deceased staged a protest demanding a CBI probe into the killings and threatened to die by suicide before the chief minister’s residence if the accused, named in their complaint, were not arrested within four days.Preliminary investigation suggested that the pond was owned by one Sanjay Singh (brother of Ranvijay), but another group from Gebipur wanted to capture it. On November 20, two separate cases were lodged by Sanjay and Mukesh Safi (a close associate of Pravin Jha), which led to Sanjay getting jailed.Additional director general (ADG) headquarters, Jitendra Kumar confirmed that the prime accused were arrested by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by Madhubani superintendent of police (SP) Dr Satya Prakash, who, acting on a tip-off, raided a house at Raghauni village, situated on Madhubani-Darbhanga border, falling under Bisfi police station and arrested four accused identified as Pravin Jha alias Ravan, Chandan Jha, Mukesh Safi, Bhola Singh and the house owner, for giving them shelter. A police post was also set up in the village to prevent any untoward incident.Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar told HT that the massacre was the result of a fight for supremacy between two groups and not two castes. “A case has been lodged against 35 persons and dozens of unidentified accused. 14 named accused have been arrested while property of one of the chief accused, Navin Jha, who is still absconding, has been attached,” said a police officer.

              " ' Real Madrid’s iconic ‘Quinta del Buitre’ side and the five-in-a-row record  Real Madrid won the LaLiga title five years in a row between 1985 and 1990, matching their own record of five consecutive titles that they’d set between 1960 and 1965. No other Spanish club has ever won five league championships in a row and, it could be argued, no other side has been as dominant as that Real Madrid team of the late 1980s.That team was so good that it became known as the ‘Quinta del Buitre,’ the nickname of the five homegrown talents who formed the core of the side: Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Rafael Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza.It all started on November 14th 1983, when journalist Julio César Iglesias published a story in Spain’s leading newspaper El País coining the term to describe the five generational talents who were poised to break into the first team. Butragueño was the pick of the bunch and his nickname, Buitre (the ‘Vulture’), stuck.During that 1983/84 season, Real Madrid’s B team, Castilla, played some of their matches at the Santiago Bernabéu and fans would flock to the stadium to see the mercurial youngsters play. In one match, almost 80,000 packed in to watch them. Castilla actually won the second division that season, but were of course prevented from being promoted to the top tier given that they wouldn’t be allowed to play in the same division as the senior side.The stars of Castilla were soon playing regular first division football, though. One by one they were promoted to the senior squad, and Amancio Amaro was promoted from his role as Castilla coach to take over the senior squad in time for the start of the 1984/85 campaign. That year, Real Madrid won the UEFA Cup and the short-lived League Cup. They retained the UEFA Cup and won a first LaLiga title in six years in 1986, kick-starting their period of complete dominance of Spanish football.Funnily enough, though this quintet came through together and marked a generation, they only ever started together at senior level on one occasion: in a 1986/87 Copa del Rey semi-final game against city rivals Atlético de Madrid. Butragueño and Pardeza both played as strikers, with the former the entrenched starter and the latter usually a substitute. Pardeza moved on to Real Zaragoza in 1985, breaking the unit up, but the quintet continued to feature alongside each other in Spain squads in the late 1980s.Butragueño remained the star of the group throughout this era, scoring 123 LaLiga goals in 341 matches. Martín Vázquez and Míchel ran the midfield, providing the ammunition for El Buitre, while Sanchis was the rock at the heart of the defence. With other stars such as Hugo Sanchez, Jorge Valdano and Juanito, the Real Madrid side of the late 1980s were nigh-on unstoppable.Their supremacy hit a peak that few had ever seen before early in the 1987/88 LaLiga season. Real Madrid returned from their summer holidays meaning business, starting the campaign with eight wins in a row, scoring 32 and conceding just two during that run. That run got going with a 4-0 win at Cádiz and a 7-0 win at home to R. Sporting. After that, Jesús Gil, the notorious Atlético de Madrid president at the time, claimed it was a fluke and that Real Madrid wouldn’t score seven again that season. Six days later, on just the third match of the season, they thrashed Real Zaragoza 7-1, proving that they were by far the best team in the country.While they did completely dominate for five seasons in a row domestically, the one trophy that was missing from this group’s collection was the European Cup. At a club like Real Madrid, with its 13 continental crowns, this remains a lingering disappointment. However, it’s the only blemish on the record of the ‘Quinta del Buitre.’ In fact, many older Real Madrid fans even hold that side in higher regard than some of the more recent Champions League-winning teams, because of the attractive and dominant football they produced. This really was a special team, the last team to achieve five in a row. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics real madrid ',\n",
              " ' Mob attacks couple inside Odisha police station  In another instance of a mob attacking police in Odisha, around 150 people attacked Remuna police station in Balasore district on Tuesday night, critically injuring two complainants. However, the outnumbered policemen escaped from the station sensing danger.The mob arrived at the police station around 11 pm on Tuesday looking to challenge the complainants-- one Raghunath Sahu and his wife Pramita Das, residents of Miyanbagh village, who were at the station complaining about the alleged ransacking of their houses by their rivals from neighbouring Mandarpur village.Remuna police station inspector Sriballav Sahu said Sahu and his wife reached the police station last night alleging their houses were ransacked by a group due to old enmity. “We were about to visit their village for an inquiry when around 150 people suddenly arrived at the police station. We immediately closed the gate but by that time 20-30 people barged into the police station and attacked the complainants leaving them critically injured,” said Sahu.The injured couple were first admitted to Remuna Community Health centre but later shifted to Balasore Medical College and Hospital after their condition deteriorated.The mob also vandalised the police station, said police. The assailants are yet to be arrested, however, a search operation has been launched based on the CCTV footage.Last month, a mob in the Jajpur district set a police jeep and a van at Balichandrapur police station on fire over enmity between two groups. In February this year, a police team escorting an accused, arrested in a case of oil theft, was allegedly attacked by villagers in the Dhenkanal district. The same month three police personnel including an assistant sub-inspector were injured in a mob attack while arresting a person accused of extortion in Jagatsinghpur district.

              " \" BCCI Apex Council meet agenda: Indian women's support staff, state T20 leagues  Following the unsanctioned conduct of the Bihar Cricket League, the BCCI is likely to form a working group to streamline the organisation of T20 events around the country in its Apex Council meeting on April 16.The Bihar Cricket Association completed the league last month despite BCCI's directive in the middle of the event stating that it was staging the tournament without the required approval.Following the success of the IPL, state T20 leagues began mushrooming around the country but most of them have come under the scanner for corruption, something which is seen as a big challenge by BCCI's new anti-corruption unit.Also among the 14-point agenda of the meeting is the appointment of the Indian women's team's support staff and its international assignments which have been hit badly by the COVID-19 pandemic.The team is set to play a Test for the first time in more than six years, as announced by secretary Jay Shah, and is expected to travel to England and Australia later this year.Also, it remains to be seen if head coach WV Raman gets an extension or the BCCI invites fresh applications for the post.Raman, who was appointed as the head coach in 2018, was with the team in the recent home series against South Africa which India lost.The BCCI is also likely to take a call on the long pending tax and visa issue ahead of the T20 World Cup in India.After its latest board meeting, the ICC said it expects hosts India to get the necessary visa guarantees and tax exemptions by the end of this month.There will also be talks on how to conduct the 2021-2022 domestic season. Last season, the BCCI had to scrap Ranji Trophy for the first time in 87 years due to the pandemic but went ahead with the T20 and one-day events.The Indian cricket board could also finalise its stand on backing the ICC's bid for cricket's inclusion in the 2028 Olympics.If it decides to support the game's inclusion in the Summer Games, it might have to give up on its autonomy and become a national sports federation.It might also grant recognition to the Differently Abled Cricket Council of India, having conducted fruitful talks with the stakeholders recently.The other agenda points include discussion on a representation made by Telangana Cricket Association and state of affairs in Jammu and Kashmir cricket, a body which the High Court has asked BCCI to run till the elections are held.

              " ' Miffed with handling of EVMs, Assam Congress wants CCTV links to strong rooms  A day after conclusion of polling for the third and final phase, Assam Congress on Wednesday asked the Election Commission (EC) to provide them links to close circuit television (CCTV) cameras of the strong rooms where electronic voting machines (EVMs) are kept before counting of votes.The opposition Congress is unhappy with the management of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during the election process, which witnessed several ‘unwanted incidents’ and is concerned about the machines before counting of votes on May 2.“Considering several unwanted incidents already been reported in respect of the EVMs and the discrepancy aroused in connection with them in several places of the state during election phases, it has now become essential to ensure protection of the EVMs from rigging by any means after conclusion of all the three phases of election in the state to protect the interest of democracy,” state Congress president Ripun Bora in a letter to chief electoral officer, Assam, Nitin Khade.Elections to the 126 assembly seats in Assam were conducted in three phases on March 27 (47 seats), April 1 (39 seats) and April 6 (40 seats).“As the strong rooms are already under CCTV surveillance with access to the concerned election officers to ensure its protection, it would also afford satisfaction to the contesting candidates if the access/link of those CCTV surveillances is provided to them and the same will definitely ensure holding of the present assembly election in the state in a fair and impartial manner,” the letter added.On March 28, a day after conclusion of the first phase of polls, Congress had written to the EC seeking permission to install CCTV cameras in the space allotted to candidates of the party in front of the strong rooms so that they could keep tabs on the EVMs.“Our party had made the request on March 28 and we are yet to get any response from the EC on it. We request the authorities to look into this matter seriously,” Bora said at a press conference in Guwahati on Wednesday.Congress has already placed four party cadres from each constituency in front of the strong rooms across the state to keep an eye on any suspicious activity before counting of votes.On April 1, after conclusion of the second phase of polling, several electronic voting machines (EVMs) from a polling station in Ratabari seat were found in the vehicle belonging to the wife of a sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from neighbouring Patharkandi. Both seats are from the Barak Valley region of the state.Following uproar over this major lapse, the Election Commission suspended four officials and ordered re-poll in the polling station to which the EVMs belonged.In a statement, the EC mentioned that the polling officials used the MLA’s wife’s car, without knowing whom it belonged to, as the official vehicle in which they were carrying the EVMs broke down while taking the machines back after polling ended. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered into the incident.Reacting to Congress’ request to the EC, ruling BJP office bearers in Assam said that while they will be monitoring the strong rooms, the party has full faith in the poll body and its management of the EVMs.“We are monitoring the strong rooms as per routine. But unlike the Congress, we have full faith in the EC and its conduct of the polls. Congress’s worry stems from the fact that they are losing. They always blame EVMs when they lose, but are happy with the machines when they win,” BJP Assam spokesperson Rupam Goswami said.(With inputs by Biswa Kalyan Purkayastha in Silchar) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Renewed Real complete transformation by blowing Liverpool away  Real Madrid produced their best display of the season in crushing Liverpool 3-1 on Tuesday to move within view of the Champions League semi-finals, staging a remarkable turnaround of the type they have become accustomed to under Zinedine Zidane.They were missing key players in Eden Hazard, Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos for the quarter-final first leg but dominated the midfield thanks to their long-running trio of Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, the foundation of their three consecutive Champions League triumphs.Zidane also got his tactics spot on, exploiting Liverpool\\'s high defensive line with long balls from deep, leading to Kroos finding Vinicius Jr. for the first goal and Marco Asensio for the second, with the help of a botched Trent Alexander-Arnold clearance.Watching Real beat the Premier League champions so comfortably, it was easy to forget what a chaotic season it has been.Hampered by the biggest injury crisis in La Liga, they fell 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid in January and were in serious danger of exiting the Champions League group stage in November.\"What the players are doing is tremendous after all the difficulties we have had.

              " ' Covid boosts risks for mental, neurological disorders in study  A third of Covid-19 survivors were diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition in the six months after being infected, according to the first large-scale research to compare the risks to other illnesses, including influenza.The University of Oxford study analyzed health records of 236,379 Covid-19 patients infected last year, according to a report in The Lancet Psychiatry journal. As might be expected, anxiety and mood disorders were the most common diagnoses, at 17% and 14% of patients respectively. But the study also found 7% of those made sickest by the virus had a stroke and 2% were diagnosed with dementia.While the investigators stressed that the specific causes of these long-term affects are largely unknown, they suggested some of might be linked to stress, job loss or loneliness during quarantine. More in-depth research is needed on the neurological risks and more resources are needed to address the full range of implications, they said.“Although the individual risks for most disorders are small, the effect across the whole population may be substantial for health and social-care systems due to the scale of the pandemic and that many of these conditions are chronic,” said Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the university and the study’s lead author.The researchers also explored data from 105,579 people with influenza and 236,038 patients with any respiratory tract infection. There was a 44% greater risk of neurological and mental health diagnoses after Covid-19 than after flu, and a 16% greater risk than with respiratory tract infections.“Although we know that the virus can access the brain, it’s not necessarily only the neurons in the brain that might be effected,” said Masud Husain, professor of neurology and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Oxford. “We need to be careful about what we attribute the effect of the virus to the brain itself.”Brain fogAt the start of the pandemic, a number of Covid patients whose symptoms were initially mild developed long-term neurological problems, what survivors refer to as “brain fog.” At the time there was no strong evidence that Covid-19 infects the brain. However, since then there have been several other studies that have made the link between Covid-19 and increased risk of neurological disorders.A study published last October found that about 4 of 5 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 suffer neurological symptoms, including muscle pain, headaches, confusion, dizziness and the loss of smell or taste. Another study from Wuhan, China, where the virus first appeared, found that 36% of patients had neurological symptoms ranging from headache to impaired consciousness.A limitation of the Oxford study is that the researchers only analyzed records of patients diagnosed with Covid, which does not take into consideration people who were infected but had no symptoms.Some of patients in the control cohort “might have also had Covid,” said Max Taquet, a study co-author. “We didn’t know that.” It means the findings could have underestimated the relative risk of developing neurological or mental health disorders.Still, the overall message is clear, according to Taquet. “We need to be proactive and establish follow-up strategy for patients who have had Covid,” he said, adding that health-care providers should be prepared to address an increased demand for assessment and treatment of these disorders.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' Females in pain not taken as seriously as male patients: Study  Researchers found that when male and female patients expressed the same amount of pain, observers viewed female patients\\' pain as less intense and more likely to benefit from psychotherapy versus medication as compared to men\\'s pain.The results of the study exposed a significant patient gender bias that could lead to disparities in treatments.The novel research published in the Journal of Pain was co-authored by Elizabeth Losin, assistant professor of psychology and director of the Social and Cultural Neuroscience lab at the University of Miami.According to \"Gender biases in the estimation of others\\' pain,\" when male and female patients expressed the same amount of pain, observers viewed female patients\\' pain as less intense and more likely to benefit from psychotherapy versus medication as compared to men\\'s pain, exposing a significant patient gender bias that could lead to disparities in treatments.The study consisted of two experiments. In the first, 50 participants were asked to view various videos of male and female patients who suffered from shoulder pain performing a series of range of motion exercises using their injured and uninjured shoulders. Researchers pulled the videos from a database that contains videos of actual shoulder injury patients, each experiencing a range of different degrees of pain. The database included patients\\' self-reported level of discomfort when moving their shoulders.According to Losin, the study likely provides results more applicable to patients in clinical settings compared to previous studies that used posed actors in their stimuli videos.\"One of the advantages of using these videos of patients who are actually experiencing pain from an injury is that we have the patients\\' ratings of their own pain,\" she explained.\"We had a ground truth to work with, which we can\\'t have if it\\'s a stimulus with an actor pretending to be in pain,\" she added.The patients\\' facial expressions were also analyzed through the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) -- a comprehensive, anatomically based system for describing all visually discernible facial movements. The researchers used these FACS values in a formula to provide an objective score of the intensity of the patients\\' pain facial expressions. This provided a second ground truth for the researchers to use when analyzing the data.The study participants were asked to gauge the amount of pain they thought the patients in the videos experienced on a scale from zero, labeled as \"absolutely no pain,\" and 100, labeled as \"worst pain possible.\"In the second experiment, researchers replicated the first portion of this study with 200 participants. This time, after viewing the videos, perceivers were asked to complete the Gender Role Expectation of Pain questionnaire, which measures gender-related stereotypes about pain sensitivity, the endurance of pain, and willingness to report pain.Perceivers also shared how much medication and psychotherapy they would prescribe to each patient and which of these treatments they believed would be more effective in treating each patient.The researchers analysed the results of the participant\\'s responses to the videos compared to the patient\\'s self-reported level of pain and the facial expression intensity data. The ability to analyse observers\\' perceptions relative to these two ground truth measures of the patients\\' pain in the videos allowed the researchers to measure bias more accurately, Losin explained. That is because bias could be defined as different ratings for male and female patients despite the same level of responses.Overall, the study found that female patients were perceived to be in less pain than the male patients who reported and exhibited, the same intensity of pain. Additional analyses using participants\\' responses to the questionnaire about gender-related pain stereotypes allowed researchers to conclude that these perceptions were partially explained by these stereotypes.\"If the stereotype is to think women are more expressive than men, perhaps \\'overly\\' expressive, then the tendency will be to discount women\\'s pain behaviours,\" Losin said.Losin further noted, \"The flip side of this stereotype is that men are perceived to be stoic, so when a man makes an intense pain facial expression, you think, \\'Oh my, he must be dying!\\' The result of this gender stereotype about pain expression is that each unit of increased pain expression from a man is thought to represent a higher increase in his pain experience than that same increase in pain expression by a woman.\"What\\'s more, psychotherapy was chosen as more effective than medication for a higher proportion of female patients compared to male patients.Additionally, the study concluded that the gender of the perceivers did not influence pain estimation. Both men and women interpreted women\\'s pain to be less intense.The idea to study disparities in the perception of pain based on a patient\\'s gender was derived from previous research, Losin said, that found women are often prescribed less treatment than men and wait longer to receive that treatment as well.

              " ' K8 School is now powered by Discovery Education  In one of the most path-breaking developments that could change the way online school education is delivered to students in India, now and in the future, K8 School, India’s first and only Cognia-accredited online school announced its content partnership with Discovery Education, USA. Discovery Education is the global leader in standards-aligned digital curriculum resources, engaging content, and professional learning for K-12 classrooms. Through its award-winning digital textbooks, multimedia resources, and the largest professional learning network of its kind, Discovery Education is transforming teaching and learning, creating immersive STEM experiences, and improving academic achievement around the globe.Discovery Education’s services are available in approximately half of U.S. classrooms and primary schools in the U.K. and reach over 5 million educators and 51 million students in more than 90 countries. Through this new content partnership, K8 school will now provide Discovery Education’s award-winning learning content to all its students across the country.K8 School is providing 100% online school to Indian students from KG to Grade 8 and is accredited by Cognia, the world’s largest and most prestigious school accreditor with a history of more than 125 years of school improvement and educational excellence.Sharad Bhatia, Founder, and CEO of K8 School, while discussing why K8 School decided to partner with Discovery Education says “The primary fabric of virtual teaching has a completely different feel as compared to that of traditional classroom teaching. The same content, same style, and same size of classrooms in a virtual set-up are rendering teaching and learning far less effective. Children aren’t going to school as they used to and they need something different and something extra to keep them engaged from the comfort of their homes.They need immersive content, that talks to them and that catalyzes their hunger to learn and understand. A lot of parents whom I talk to tell me that their children aren’t as mentally active as they were about a year ago and that they have enrolled their children in various tuitions and online classes other than those in school to keep them busy. How long will this go on?Keeping children busy with classes with the expectation that they will at least learn something by default, isn’t the solution. Research has proven that learning is far more effective if students can see and experience how concepts unfold in real-life scenarios because then they can relate better to those concepts. We could see all of this coming and that is why we founded K8 School in the first place. At a time when students around the world are enjoying the privilege of accessing high-quality learning content, why should our children in India be left behind.”In the official statement issued on this new association with Discovery Education, he adds “Keeping the interests of schoolers in India, I am excited to announce that K8 School has now forged a content-partnership with Discovery Education. We will offer STEM Connect, Science Techbook, and Coding curriculum packs of Discovery Education to all our students free of cost. Our mission is to ensure that all students at K8 School get the best world-class education so that they can compete with their peers and age groups across the globe. Our maximum teacher-to-student ratio is 9:1. Students get exposure to culturally divergent peer groups from all over the country, a host of extra-curricular activities, conversations with experts from different industries and careers, personal and academic counseling and so much more, thus making learning more experiential, engaging, immersive.And if you look at the large bouquet of services that we are providing students, you will conclude that we are the most affordable accredited online school in the world. Plus, we are offering lots of scholarships as well under our flagship ‘Surakshit Bharat, Sashakt Bharat Scholarship Program’. Our school operates in a way so that students get time to pursue their career goals on one hand and focus on their academics on the other. We have many more partnerships in the pipeline as we are ready to support parents and students by preparing them for the future. We aspire to become the best online school in the world within the next 2 years.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' US disbursed over 150 million stimulus payments in Biden relief plan  The Biden administration has officially distributed more than 150 million stimulus checks as of Wednesday from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, one of the key benchmarks the president had hoped to hit during his first 100 days in office.The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have sent out roughly 156 million payments to people, totaling roughly $372 billion, according to the Treasury Department. The majority of these latest payments went to Social Security recipients and beneficiaries, providing a cash infusion more than a year into the pandemic.During the transition, Biden aides said the president’s chief goals for his first 100 days in office included distributing relief checks, re-opening schools and heightening the pace of vaccinations. On Tuesday, the White House announced it had surpassed its goal of delivering 150 million shots to Americans since he first took office. Originally, the White House had set a goal of delivering 100 million inoculations during the first 100 days.This is the fourth block of relief checks the federal government has sent since the president signed the American Rescue Plan, and this one includes 25 million payments for a total value of $36 billion.The largest group of recipients in this batch is Social Security beneficiaries who did not file tax returns in 2019 or 2020; this includes people who receive Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits. Other payments went to Americans on Supplemental Security Income and Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries.The IRS sent the checks weeks after the agency first started to process payments for other Americans, a delay which annoyed Democrats on Capitol Hill.Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee have been urging the IRS to expedite the payments, arguing they unnecessary delays hurt vulnerable Americans. The delay in payments for about 30 million Social Security beneficiaries stemmed from the Social Security Administration not sending the IRS an updated list of eligible people until March 25, according to House Democrats.The majority of people who receive their payments -- 25 million of them -- will do so through direct deposit, whereas more than 1 million people will receive paper checks. The Treasury Department and IRS started to process the payments on Friday, April 2, for an official payment date of April 7.Veterans Affairs beneficiaries are to receive their payments on April 14.The IRS has an online tool for people to check the status of their payment.

              " \" North Korea tells WHO it's still coronavirus-free  Isolated North Korea has continued to claim a perfect record in keeping out the coronavirus in its latest report to the World Health Organisation.At the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, North Korea described its efforts to keep out the virus as a “matter of national existence.”It shut its borders, banned tourists and jetted out diplomats. It still severely limits cross-border traffic and has quarantined tens of thousands of people who have shown symptoms.But it still says it has found no case of COVID-19, a widely doubted claim given its poor health infrastructure and a porous border with China, its economic lifeline.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday, Edwin Salvador, WHO's representative to North Korea, said the North has reported it tested 23,121 people for the coronavirus from the beginning of the pandemic to April 1 and that all results were negative. Salvador said the North said 732 people were tested between March 26 and April 1.WHO officials say the North is no longer providing the UN agency with the number of people it quarantines with suspected symptoms.North Korea said Tuesday it would skip the Tokyo Olympics to protect athletes from the “world public health crisis caused by COVID-19.”The UN-backed programme to ship COVID-19 vaccines worldwide said in February that North Korea could receive 1.9 million vaccine doses in the first half of this year.However, COVAX has since warned of global shortages because the Serum Institute of India, which is licensed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, is putting its supplies into domestic demand while India's virus caseload is surging.

He had represented the Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals), the Mumbai Indians and the Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) in the past editions.Before getting picked by RCB in the IPL 2021 players’ auction, Maxwell represented the Punjab-based franchise last year and had a horrific season.

              " ' Study of Astra vaccinations in children is paused, Oxford says  The vaccine researchers are awaiting the results of a review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the U.K.’s drug watchdog, the university said in an emailed statement. No safety issues have arisen in the children’s trial, Oxford said.The action comes as the European Union’s medicines regulator prepares to provide an updated assessment of the shot’s safety at about 4 p.m. Amsterdam time. A number of reports of ocassional brain blood clots in younger adults have led some countries, including several in the EU, to suspend use of the vaccine in certain age groups. Germany halted its use in people younger than 60 last week.Drug regulators in the UK and EU have said that a connection between the clots and the vaccine is possible but unclear, and that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. The European Medicines Agency’s planned update may indicate a potential link between the drugmaker’s shot and the blood clots, Italian newspaper Il Messaggero reported Tuesday, quoting Marco Cavaleri, chair of the EMA’s vaccine evaluation team.US trial plannedCavaleri’s comments were personal and preliminary, the drug regulator said by email..Amid concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine, the UK began rolling out a shot from Moderna Inc. on Wednesday, ahead of the expected timetable. Britain is also immunizing people with a vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE.AstraZeneca shares fell 0.7% Wednesday at 10:37 a.m. in London.The UK’s regulator said Saturday that it had identified 30 cases of a rare combination of blood clots and low platelets in people in Britain who had received the Astra shot through March 24, of whom seven died.The Oxford trial plans to enroll 300 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17, the university said when it began the study in February. As many as 240 participants will receive the coronavirus vaccine and the remainder a meningitis shot. Initial data from the trial is expected by the summer, Oxford said at the time.Astra is planning to start a larger US trial for children, similar to those run by Pfizer and Moderna, in the coming months.Parents and children continue to attend all scheduled visits and can contact the trial sites if they have any questions, the university said in the statement.

              " ' Covid-19: Five questions about vaccination  Facile comments about making the Covid-19 vaccine available to those who need it, rather than those who want it, hide the fact that India’s vaccine strategy needs an urgent reboot, one that requires honest answers to five questions. But first, it is important to accept one universal truth — everyone needs the vaccine, even though some may not want it. Question one — is India staring at a vaccine supply crunch? The simple answer is yes, provided it doesn’t approve any more vaccines, and provided the makers of the two currently authorised vaccines do not increase their capacity, for which they have sought government funds. The crunch could mean that the country currently has access to just about 50-60% of the five million doses it hopes to administer every day.Question two — why, if there was going to be an imminent supply crunch, did the government engage in vaccine diplomacy? Truth be told, only 10.5 million vaccines were given as grants, with 35 million being exported commercially and another 18 million exported under World Health Organization (WHO)’s COVAX facility, but that question will keep being raised till domestic vaccination gets a further boost. Question three — why are other vaccines not being approved? As sound as the need for a bridging study is for vaccines approved in other geographies, it is hard to ignore the fact that India’s drug regulator had no problems approving Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin largely on faith (the data wasn’t available when it was approved). Approving some of the other vaccines, including Sputnik, could mean a boost in supply. Russia’s sovereign wealth fund has already struck deals with Indian manufacturers to make 700 million doses of the highly effective vaccine.Question four — is an age-based criteria the best way to determine priority for vaccination? After all, the burden of Covid has been, and continues to be, disproportionate in urban areas, and everyone may gain if vaccination were opened up to all in hotspots. And question five (which should have actually been the first question) — how serious is India’s political leadership about the Covid-safety protocol? They have participated in high-intensity poll campaigning (and will continue to do so in West Bengal, where five stages of polling remain), even though there has been little social distancing in their rallies and road shows. Only when the government honestly addresses each of these questions responsibly will India be able to battle the second wave. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " \" IIT Guwahati team develops technique to boost performance of lithium ion battery  Researchers of IIT-Guwahati have developed an advanced technique to boost the overall performance of rechargeable lithium ion batteries used in electric vehicles, the premier engineering technology institute said on Wednesday.The technique can precisely estimate the state of charge (SOC), which reflects the remaining capacity of the battery. This helps in knowing how much more charge can be withdrawn before the battery gets fully discharged, a release issued by the premier engineering technology institute said.The knowledge of the remaining capacity helps to optimize the battery's capacity utilisation, prevent overcharging and undercharging of the battery, increases its lifespan, reduces cost and ensures the safety of the battery and its surroundings, the release said.The research team comprises of research scholar Gautam Sethia, associate professor Sisir Kumar Nayak and professor Somanath Majhi from the department of electronics and electrical engineering, IIT Guwahati.SOC cannot be directly measured by any sensor and can only be inferred by using the available measured quantities such as battery terminal voltage and current, it said.As the highly non-linear characteristic of the lithium ion battery makes it difficult to estimate the SOC accurately, a well-developed estimation algorithm is crucial in ensuring precise, reliable, and cost-effective SOC estimation.The research findings were recently published in IEEE Transactions on Circuit and System I: Regular Papers, a highly reputed international scientific journal.The proposed technique shows highly robust characteristics and works accurately even in the presence of various external disturbances such as sensor inaccuracy and temperature variation, a researcher said.It not only increases accuracy but also reduces the computational time and hence needs a cost effective microcontroller chip for its implementation and commercialisation, another researcher said.In recent years, lithium ion batteries have been widely recognised in various applications due to their low carbon emission, high energy density, low self-discharge rate and low maintenance cost.Apart from the various day-to-day small devices such as cell phones and laptops, these batteries have also been widely used in various other important applications such as electric vehicles, in renewable energy sources integrated smart grids and microgrids, the release added.The research team is currently working on other important battery issues such as cell balancing, monitoring the state of health, state of power and other things, the IIT Guwahati release said.

Pant was appointed captain of the team Shreyas Iyer was ruled out due to an injured shoulder, and with fantastic batting form behind him, the 23-year-old would be hoping he can pass the captaincy test too.Pant\\'s India and DC teammate R Ashwin commented on his new captain, saying the wicketkeeper is blessed with an aspect in batting which sets him apart from the rest of the cricketers. The left-handed Pant, who made his return in the Indian team during the Test series against Australia and has been in belligerent form since, has produced brilliant knocks one after the other, and Ashwin feels people should give Pant and his captaincy time before jumping to conclusions.\"Many people say that he is fearless and all that. I think he is naturally blessed with a good bat swing. Lot of people crave for that bat swing. He is able to produce immense power; that is not an ordinary thing for a cricketer. I think that really sets him apart,\" Ashwin told The New Indian Express.\"We have to give him a chance and wait and see what he does. He comes from a modest background. He has a simple attitude in life and has made a comeback of sorts recently. I wish him all the best and hope that he can deliver.\"Ashwin weighed in on the addition of Steve Smith in the team, saying the former Australia captain\\'s experience would be beneficial in the absence of Iyer. Smith, who led Rajasthan Royals last IPL, was released by the franchise and picked by DC at the IPL 2021 auction for ₹2.2 crore.\"Having an experienced player is always good for us, especially now that Shreyas is not there, which is a big blow for us.

The local TMC administration is now demanding money from people to go ahead with it. I wanted to execute the project without charging a penny,\" he said.Attacking the TMC government over its \"failure\" to create job opportunities, Banerjee sought to punch a hole in the ruling party\\'s poll plank of securing the the top spot for implementation of the 100-day rural job scheme, declaring it as \"a reflection of West Bengal, a failed state\".\"There are over 5.5 lakh vacancies in state government departments, and no efforts were made to recruit people for the posts. Instead, the TMC dispensation hired a few thousand contractual workers.\"People do not have jobs, and that is why they sought work under the MGNRGA scheme. Youths are leaving the state,\" Banerjee, who holds an MBA degree, said.Asked about allegations that he enjoyed all the power and perks of his position before ditching the TMC prior to the elections, the former Irrigation Minister said people of the constituency are well aware of his development work in the area.\"Let the TMC leaders say whatever they want. People will decide on April 10 (the day of polling in Domjur)... I know they will not disappoint me, said Banerjee, who is believed to have considerable influence in several seats of Howrah district.The TMC turncoat, however, maintained that he has immense respect for TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and had to desert the party with a heavy heart as he was cornered.\"Unfortunately, I was not allowed to work independently in the second term and sidelined in the party. I had to face personal attacks for airing grievances against a section of top leaders.\"I was also meted out a step-motherly treatment ever since winning from the constituency with more than one lakh votes for a second term in 2016,\" he claimed.Banerjee also took a swipe at TMC\\'s \\'khela habe\\' (game will happen) poll slogan, insisting that such a discourse by the ruling party shows it has become politically bankrupt.Attired in a traditional \\'kurta pyajama\\', Banerjee, the nephew of former state minister in the Congress government Mritunjay Banerjee, has been traversing the length and breadth of Domjur, around 16 km from Kolkata, exuding confidence of a hat-trick win.

              " ' US military cites rising risk of Chinese move against Taiwan  The American military is warning that China is probably accelerating its timetable for capturing control of Taiwan, the island democracy that has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.The worry about Taiwan comes as China wields new strength from years of military buildup. It has become more aggressive with Taiwan and more assertive in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing also has become more confrontational with Washington; senior Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in talks in Alaska last month.A military move against Taiwan, however, would be a test of U.S. support for the island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. For the Biden administration, it could present the choice of abandoning a friendly, democratic entity or risking what could become an all-out war over a cause that is not on the radar of most Americans. The United States has long pledged to help Taiwan defend itself, but it has deliberately left unclear how far it would go in response to a Chinese attack.This accumulation of concerns meshes with the administration’s view that China is a frontline challenge for the United States and that more must be done soon — militarily, diplomatically and by other means — to deter Beijing as it seeks to supplant the United States as the predominant power in Asia. Some American military leaders see Taiwan as potentially the most immediate flashpoint.“We have indications that the risks are actually going up,\" Adm. Philip Davidson, the most senior U.S. military commander in the Asia-Pacific region, told a Senate panel last month, referring to a Chinese military move on Taiwan.“The threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” Davidson said.Days later, Davidson\\'s expected successor, Adm. John Aquilino, declined to back up the six-year timeframe but told senators at his confirmation hearing: \"My opinion is, this problem is much closer to us than most think.”Biden administration officials have spoken less pointedly but stress the intention to deepen ties with Taiwan, eliciting warnings from Beijing against outsider interference in what it considers a domestic matter.On Wednesday, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the military threat against his country is increasing, and while he said it was not yet “particularly alarming,” the Chinese military in the last couple of years has been conducting what he called “real combat-type” exercises closer to the island.“We are willing to defend ourselves, that’s without any question,” Wu told reporters. “We will fight a war if we need to fight a war, and if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day, then we will defend ourselves to the very last day.“Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calls China the “pacing threat” for the United States, and the military services are adjusting accordingly. The Marine Corps, for example, is reshaping itself with China and Russia in mind after two decades of ground-focused combat against extremists in the Middle East.Hardly an aspect of China\\'s military modernization has failed to rile the U.S. military. Adm. Charles Richard, who as head of U.S. Strategic Command is responsible for U.S. nuclear forces, wrote in a recent essay that China is on track to be a “strategic peer” of the United States. He said China\\'s nuclear weapons stockpile is expected to double “if not triple or quadruple\" in the next 10 years, although that goes beyond the Pentagon\\'s official view that the stockpile will “at least double” in that period.Taiwan, however, is seen as the most pressing problem.U.S. officials have noted People’s Liberation Army actions that seem designed to rattle Taiwan. For example, Chinese aerial incursions, including flying around the island, are a near-daily occurrence, serving to advertise the threat, wear down Taiwanese pilots and aircraft and learn more about Taiwan’s capabilities.Chinese officials have scoffed at Davidson\\'s Taiwan comments. A Ministry of Defense spokesman, Col. Ren Guoqiang, urged Washington to “abandon zero-peace thinking” and do more to build mutual trust and stability. He said that “attempts by outside forces to use Taiwan to seek to restrain China, or the use by Taiwan independence forces to use military means to achieve independence, are all dead ends.”The implications of a Chinese military move against Taiwan and its 23 million people are so profound and potentially grave that Beijing and Washington have long managed a fragile middle ground — Taiwanese political autonomy that precludes control by Beijing but stops short of formal independence.Predictions of when China might decide to try to compel Taiwan to reunite with the mainland have long varied, and there is no uniform view in the United States. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said last week he doubts Chinese leaders are ready to force the issue.“I don’t think it’s coming soon,” he said.The Trump administration made a series of moves to demonstrate a stronger commitment to Taiwan, including sending a Cabinet member to Taipei last year, making him the highest-level U.S. official to visit the island since formal diplomatic relations were severed in 1979 in deference to China. The Biden administration says it wants to cooperate with China where possible but has voiced its objections to a wide range of Chinese actions.Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the Pacific island nation of Palau, John Hennessey-Niland, became the first serving U.S. ambassador to visit Taiwan since Washington cut ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing.China is a frequent target of criticism in Congress. Concerns about countering its growing military might are reflected in passage of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, funded at $2.2 billion for 2021. Davidson wants it to support, among other initiatives, establishing a better air defense system to protect the U.S. territory of Guam from Chinese missiles and preserving U.S. military dominance in the region.Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, is skeptical of the military\\'s fixation on dominance.“Given the way the world works now, having one country be dominant is just hopelessly unrealistic,” he said in a recent online forum sponsored by Meridian, a nonpartisan diplomacy center. He said the U.S. military can maintain sufficient strength, in partnership with allies, to send the message: “China, don\\'t invade Taiwan because the price you\\'re going to pay for that isn\\'t worth it.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics china united states ',\n",

She was ranked world No. 9 at that point.So, Sania currently has a special ranking of 9th and has already qualified for the Tokyo Olympics.The special rankings were introduced by WTA because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Sania was inactive for two years due to pregnancy and only made her return to the court last year following the birth of her son at the season-opening Hobart International WTA event.She partnered Ukrainian Nadiia Kichenok to win the women\\'s doubles title.

              " ' Pak-linked ISI terror module busted in Gujarat; three held  The Ahmedabad crime branch on Wednesday arrested three persons for allegedly setting ablaze seven shops here as part of a larger conspiracy of Pakistan\\'s spy agency ISI to spread terror by luring unsuspecting petty criminals in need of money, officials said.They have been booked under IPC sections for waging war against the government and provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), they said.An unidentified ISI agent, without revealing his true identity or motive, had allegedly lured the three men to set the shops on fire here in Gujarat as part of the ISI\\'s plans to spread terror, jeopardise internal security and cause economic losses to India, the police said.Those arrested have been identified as Bhupendra Vanzara, Anil Khatik and Ankit Pal, they said.Pal was admitted to hospital under police protection as he had tested positive for coronavirus.As directed by the ISI handler, who used to identify himself as Baba Bhai and has several Facebook profiles with similar names, the three accused set ablaze seven cloth shops in Kalupur area here on the night of March 20, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Premvir Singh told reporters.\"After the incident, we received intelligence inputs that the shops were deliberately set on fire by some men at the behest of the ISI. Following a detailed probe into the matter, we nabbed the three men,\" he said.\"The three accused received ₹1.5 lakh from the ISI agent via Dubai-Mumbai \\'angadia\\' (courier) route for setting the shops on fire,\" he said.Vanzara is a petty criminal and came in contact with the ISI agent through Facebook, the official said.Baba Bhai, without revealing his identity or motive, offered money to Vanzara to kill random people and set shops afire, the official claimed.\"Vanzara had earlier taken ₹25,000 from the ISI agent through Paytm to buy a gun,\" Singh said.Deputy Commissioner of Police Chaitanya Mandlik said Baba Bhai used to send friend requests to people having criminal mentality and those in need of money.\"We traced some of the IP addresses, used by the ISI agent to chat with Vanzara, to Karachi, which establishes the ISI connection. This was a money trap laid by them to lure Indian citizens to spread terror and cause economic losses,\" Mandlik said.The trio and the unidentified ISI agent, who was giving instructions to them from abroad, have been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 121 (waging war against the government) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy), and relevant provisions of the UAPA, the police said.

              " ' City gives De Bruyne new deal, reveals EPL’s highest payroll  Manchester City now has the Premier League’s largest-ever wage bill, and it is set to keep on growing.Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne secured improved terms on Wednesday with a two-year extension that contracts him to City until 2025.The deal was announced as the club\\'s annual report showed employee costs rose 11% in the last financial year to 351 million pounds ($485 million). City\\'s payroll costs now eclipse those across Manchester at United, which dropped from to 284 million pounds in the same period covering the pandemic-disrupted 2019-20 season.And the footnotes of City\\'s finance document disclose that this season\\'s ongoing pursuit of a quadruple, while illustrious for the club, could come with a large price.City said that additional transfer payments, signing-on fees and loyalty bonuses will be due to players and clubs of up to 158.2 million pounds “upon the achievement of certain conditions.”Pep Guardiola\\'s side remains on course to produce its most successful season since the influx of cash from Abu Dhabi owner Sheikh Mansour, with his takeover in 2008 transforming City into one of England\\'s most successful clubs.City leads the standings by 14 points as it closes in on a third Premier League title in four seasons. This month there is a semifinal against Chelsea in the FA Cup and a League Cup final against Tottenham for the holders.The one major prize to elude City is the Champions League and De Bruyne scored one of the goals that secured a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their quarterfinal on Tuesday. A cross from the Professional Footballers’ Association\\'s 2020 player of the year also started the move for Phil Foden to score the winner at the Etihad Stadium.Now De Bruyne, who has won seven trophies since joining City in 2015, is reported to be earning over 300,000 pounds a week.“This football club is geared for success,\" the Belgium international said. \"It offers me everything I need to maximise my performance, so signing this contract was a straightforward decision. I am playing the best football of my career and I honestly feel there is more to come.“Pep and I see football in the same way. Having that relationship with a manager is so important to me because our objectives are totally aligned, and we want the same things.\"De Bruyne will be hoping there are finally fans allowed back into the stadium to see him lift the Premier League trophy in May — as is planned. The return of spectators will help to stem the flow of losses that reached 126 million pounds in 2019-20 after making a profit of 10 million pounds the previous year, as revenue during the pandemic dropped 11% to 478 million pounds.

              " \" Dutch police make arrest in thefts of Van Gogh, Hals works  Dutch police arrested a suspect Tuesday in the theft last year of two valuable paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Frans Hals from different museums, a spokeswoman said. The paintings, however, remain missing.In a statement posted on Twitter, police spokeswoman Maren Wonder said a 58-year-old man was arrested at his home in the Dutch town of Baarn, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. His identity was not released, in line with Dutch privacy guidelines.“Unfortunately, we haven’t yet recovered the paintings and the investigation is continuing,” Wonder said. She called the arrest “a really important step in the investigation.”Van Gogh's “The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884” was snatched from the Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam in the early hours of March 30, 2020. The museum was closed at the time due to a coronavirus lockdown.The 25-by-57-centimeter (10-by-22-inch) oil-on-paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background.The Hals work, “Two Laughing Boys,” was stolen some five months later from Museum Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden in Leerdam, 60 kilometers (about 35 miles) south of Amsterdam.The Van Gogh painting was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands when a burglar smashed through reinforced glass doors to get into the Singer Laren, which is less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the town where the suspect was arrested.Singer Laren spokeswoman Esther Driessen welcomed the arrest and said she hopes it leads detectives to the painting.“The most important thing is that the painting returns as quickly as possible to the Groninger Museum, where it belongs,” she said.The Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden had no comment on the arrest. Police said last year that the same Hals painting was stolen in 1988 together with a work by Jacob van Ruisdael. Both were recovered three years later.In 2011, the two paintings were again stolen and recovered six months later.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The public outrage was so huge that the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The investigation is now being conducted by three central agencies - CBI, Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Asked if the alleged drug trail and political involvement in the case of Sushant\\'s death could make for a \"good screenplay\", RGV told a leading daily, \"It might, or it might not.

              " ' 4 die, scores hospitalised due to drinking water contamination in Andhra  Four persons, including two women, died and scores of others were hospitalised in the last 24 hours due to severe gastroenteritis triggered by contaminated drinking water in Andhra Pradesh’s Kurnool district, officials said. Three residents of Nandyal city died on Tuesday evening while under treatment at different hospitals in the district and the fourth victim, a 50-year-old woman, died in a hospital at Adoni town on Wednesday morning. Officials said the three victims from Nandyal also suffered from other health complications. “A 35-year-old man was a chronic alcoholic and died while under treatment at a private hospital following symptoms of diarrhoea. Another 56-year-old man, suffering from kidney-ailments, was referred to government general hospital at Kurnool, where he breathed his last. Another 80-year-old woman, who also suffered from symptoms of diarrhoea, died due to age-related issues,” Kurnool district medical and health officer Dr Rama Giddaiah said. According to the District Medical and Health Office (DMHO), as many as 15 persons from Aruna Jyothi Nagar in Adoni town were admitted to the local hospital on Tuesday evening due to gastroenteritis. “Of them, eight members were under 10 years and the other seven were adults. Of the adults, a 50-year-old woman died at about 8.20 am on Wednesday, while being referred to a private nursing home. The condition of all the others was stable,” Giddaiah said. The district authorities have found that the people suffered from gastroenteritis after consuming water at Maremma Durgamma Devara, a folk festival at Gorakallu in Panyam block. “We have set up a health camp at Gorakallu, where 35 cases of diarrhoea were reported. A team of doctors treated 30 cases and referred the remaining five cases to Nandyal government hospital,” the DMHO said.

              " \" Star India sports head wants Board to ensure IPL value before expanding  The Indian Premier League (IPL) starting on Friday is likely to be the last eight-team edition. As BCCI gears up for an expansion of the glitzy T20 tournament, the highly successful home-and-away format (60 matches) will become history.Entries will soon be invited for two new teams to join up for IPL 2022. Broadcaster Star India, which contributes 80% to the revenue stream and holds the rights till the next edition, fears there could be an erosion in value if the expansion is not thought through. “IPL has reached a scale where it can grow, and it was only a matter of time,” said Sanjog Gupta, Sports head, Star and Disney India. “The watch out though is that a longer league will have a problem in the middle. Fans start dropping off as the tournament starts becoming predictable, before they come back towards the end. With the middle set to become longer with a longer window and more matches, it can potentially lead to erosion in value. The IPL ecosystem—BCCI, the broadcaster and the franchises—need to come together to solve how to ensure retention of interest amongst fans.”ALSO READ| IPL 2021: Full schedule, venues, dates, timings- All you need to know about Indian Premier League 2021The last attempt at IPL expansion was in 2011 when two teams were added without an adequate window. Rising Pune Warriors and Kochi Tuskers Kerala came in paying big money but the 74-match league with teams divided in two groups lacked the competitiveness the home-and-away format provides. The following year, Kochi Tuskers was removed, and Pune Warriors fell after IPL 2013.For those three years (10 and 9-team events), the model of each team playing the other twice to decide the playoffs had to be abandoned. For that format to be retained in a 10-team IPL next year, it would require 94 matches and prolonged availability of overseas players. It could then become a league of two-and-a-half months. This edition runs for 51 days, from Friday to May 30.ALSO READ| IPL 2021: Full list of records & milestones Hardik Pandya can achieve this season“This is a complex problem which requires solutions at different levels and across facets. There have to be scheduling, format, window, marketing and packaging/product solutions. It’s only with all five solutions in place can you address the eminent problem,” said Gupta. Star pays the Indian board R54.5 crore per IPL match. It will have to factor in 34 more matches if the expansion goes through before 2022.IMPACT ON TESTSAn extended IPL window would eat into three weeks of India player availability too, and Test cricket could feel the ripple effect. BCCI earns an impressive R60.1 crore per Test, but that’s out of bundled sales of all three formats. If a separate value is not attached to each format, market forces could correct costs in the next rights cycle.“There are three formats, and each should have a reason to exist. Because at the end of the day the asset is limited, which are the players who can only play a certain number of days in a year. You can’t keep expanding the number of days you can play,” said Gupta.ALSO READ| 'Health is happiness': MI's Hardik, Krunal, Lynn share fitness tips on World Health Day ahead of IPL 2021“One objective is to deepen the love for the game for the core viewers who Test cricket caters to. The other is to grow the game both in terms of younger and newer fans as well as to new markets in India and away. For that T20 is more suited. There has to be a more strategic outlook to the way cricket is structured to arrive at the ideal mix of how many days of Test, ODI and T20 cricket should be played over a four to eight-year cycle based on where your imperatives lie.”Interestingly, these conversations come at a time when India are the No.1 Test team, have an exciting set of Test players who beat Australia away in a comeback series for ages and spun a web around England at home. They will be playing the World Test Championship final against New Zealand at Southampton in June.ALSO READ| IPL 2021: MI all-rounder Kieron Pollard finishes 7-day quarantine, ready to train“It’s a really interest topic which requires a deep reflection,” Gupta said of the record ratings the England Tests generated. “India-England series was the most watched Test series in the last five years in India. For all practical purposes (it) would suggest there is a resurgence and interest for Test cricket. But the interesting thing is the series before that where India made a remarkable comeback in Australia and was a historic series saw a dip in viewership compared to the last India tour of Australia (2018-19). So, there isn’t a uniform trend here.”It could be argued that three of the four Australia Tests were being played in different time zones and England series could have benefited from the high of Australia. Gupta says commercial realities are different. “Both in terms of engagement and viewership, a Test match day as compared to a T20 match day is anywhere between 1/8th to 1/10th. You have to find the right mix. While you want to cater to core fans who have a deep love for the game, you also need to devote enough days for the more popular formats so that you don’t miss out on a handshake with the young fans, which you should be looking to do year after year.”Indian Test cricket, like England and Australia, is better placed. BCCI's commercial rights are secured until 2023. ICC Chairman Greg Barclay though says, “Test cricket has got its legacy and I am a purist, but I do accept that as much as I want to keep it as it is, less and less countries are able to afford that arrangement and are able to play it,” he said in November. “Very few countries can make it work from a financial point of view.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics ipl 2021 indian premier league star sports network bcci + 2 more \",\n",
              " \" Chanu, Phogat stand to gain due to North Korea’s withdrawal  The biggest upheaval due to North Korea’s withdrawal from the Tokyo Olympics will be felt in the weightlifting arena and India’s Mirabai Chanu, seen as a medal prospect in Tokyo, will stand to gain.Weightlifting has been North Korea’s dominant discipline in the Summer Olympics. The country won 10 medals, including five gold, in the last three editions. In all, North Korea has 17 weightlifting medals at the Olympics, followed by 10 in wrestling. With North Korean weightlifters ranked high in the world in several of the 14 categories (7 men, 7 women), they were again strong medal contenders.In Chanu’s category (49kg), North Korea’s Ri Song-gum is third in world ranking, a spot ahead of the Indian. Two weightlifters from China – Hou Zhihui and Jiang Huihua - occupy the first two places. Only one from China can compete in the category. With Ri’s absence, Chanu will be better placed to push for a podium finish.At the 2019 world championships, Chanu just missed a medal, finishing fourth. She was beaten by Ri to the bronze. Ri lifted a total of 204kg while Chanu's overall lift was 201kg - her personal best at the time. The Chinese lifters were way ahead for a gold-silver finish. Jiang had a total lift of 212 kg while Hou lifted 211 kg. With Ri's absence, Chanu can hope to put herself in the medal bracket. Fourth-placed Ana Segura of Colombia was way below with 188kg.Since then, Chanu has bettered her personal best to 203 kg (88kg in snatch, 115kg in clean and jerk) at the 2020 senior nationals.The Asian Championships from April 16-25 will be a good indicator for Chanu to see where she stands. It is a gold level Olympic qualifying event. The weightlifting qualifying period runs till April 30. Chanu is third in the qualification race, behind Hou and Ri. USA's Delacruz Jourdan Elizabeth, who is behind Chanu in the qualifying race, has a best of 195kg.Chanu had a miserable 2016 Rio Olympics in 48kg. She failed in all three attempts in clean-and-jerk. She though won gold in the division at the 2017 world championships.In 49kg, she has been targeting 207-210 kg for the Tokyo Olympics. She came back strongly to win gold at the 2017 World Championships in 48kg. The weight classes have since been revised and she has moved to 49kg.Vinesh PhogatAnother big Indian star who is likely to gain is Vinesh Phogat as North Korean world champion in 53 kg, Pak Yong-mi out of the way. Vinesh will still have plenty of competition in a world class field. Japan's Mayu Mukaida has often blocked her way. She beat the Indian in the Round of 16 at the world championships, going on to win silver. Mukaida again was too strong for Vinesh at the Asian Championships final here last year. Then there is China's Pang Qianyu, bronze medallist in the 2018 and 2019 worlds. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics saikhom mirabai chanu \",\n",

              " ' Iranian ship said to be Revolutionary Guard base in Red Sea off Yemen attacked  An Iranian ship believed to be a base for the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and anchored for years in the Red Sea off Yemen has been attacked, Tehran acknowledged Wednesday.Iran\\'s Foreign Ministry confirmed the attack on the MV Saviz, suspected to have been carried out by Israel — though Tehran did not immediately blamed its regional archenemy. The assault came as Iran and world powers sat down in Vienna for the first talks about the U.S. potentially rejoining the tattered deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program, showing events outside the negotiations could derail those efforts.The ship\\'s long presence in the region, repeatedly criticized by Saudi Arabia, has come as the West and United Nations experts say Iran has provided arms and support to Yemen\\'s Houthi rebels in that country\\'s yearslong war. Iran denies arming the Houthis, though components found in the rebels\\' weaponry link back to Tehran.Iran previously described the Saviz as aiding in “anti-piracy” efforts in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb strait, a crucial chokepoint in international shipping. A statement attributed to Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh described the ship as a commercial vessel.“Fortunately, no casualties were reported ... and technical investigations are underway,\" Khatibzadeh said. \"Our country will take all necessary measures through international authorities.”In an earlier state TV statement, an anchor cited a New York Times story, which quoted an anonymous U.S. official telling the newspaper that Israel informed America it carried out an attack Tuesday morning on the vessel. Israeli officials declined to comment about the assault when reached by The Associated Press, as did the Saviz\\'s owner.Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, while refusing to say if his country launched the attack, described Iran and its regional allies as a major threat.“Israel must continue to defend itself,” Gantz told journalists. “Any place we find an operational challenge and necessity, we will continue to act.”Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the Vienna talks a “success” while speaking to his Cabinet on Wednesday.“Today, one united statement is being heard that all sides of the nuclear deal have concluded that there is no better solution than the deal,” he said.Iran\\'s semiofficial Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, reported that a limpet mine planted on Saviz\\'s hull caused the blast. A limpet mine is a type of naval mine that is attached to the side of a ship, usually by a diver. It later explodes, and can significantly damage a vessel. Iran did not blame anyone for the attack and said Iranian officials likely would offer more information in the coming days.In a statement, the U.S. military’s Central Command only said it was “aware of media reporting of an incident involving the Saviz in the Red Sea.”“We can confirm that no U.S. forces were involved in the incident,” the command said. “We have no additional information to provide.”The Saviz, owned by the state-linked Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, came to the Red Sea in late 2016, according to ship-tracking data. In the years since, it has drifted off the Dahlak archipelago, a chain of islands off the coast of the African nation of Eritrea. It likely received supply replenishments and switched crew via passing Iranian vessels using the waterway.Briefing materials from the Saudi military earlier obtained by the AP showed men on the vessel dressed in military-style fatigues, as well as small boats capable of ferrying cargo to the Yemeni coast. Those materials also included pictures showing a variety of antennas on the vessel that the Saudi government described as unusual for a commercial cargo ship, suggesting it conducted electronic surveillance. Other images showed the ship had mounts for .50-caliber machine guns.The Washington Institute for Near-East Policy has called the Saviz an “Iranian mothership” in the region, similarly describing it as an intelligence-gathering base and an armory for the Guard. Policy papers from the institute don\\'t explain how they came to that conclusion, though its analysts routinely have access to Gulf and Israeli military sources.The Saviz had been under international sanctions until Iran\\'s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran receive relief from sanctions in exchange for limiting its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration later renewed American sanctions on the Saviz as part of its decision to unilaterally withdraw from the accord.In June 2019, Saudi Arabia flew a critically ill Iranian off the Saviz after Tehran made a request through the United Nations for assistance.Amid the wider tensions between the U.S. and Iran, a series of mysterious blasts have targeted ships in the region, including some the U.S. Navy blamed on Iran. Among the ships damaged recently was an Israeli-owned car carrier in an attack Netanyahu blamed on Iran. Another was an Iranian cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea.Iran also has blamed Israel for a recent series of attacks, including a mysterious explosion in July that destroyed an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at its Natanz nuclear facility. Another is the November killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program two decades ago.

Nasa, to clear the confusion, shared another post explaining that the rainbow-like shape is actually a lens fare.“Many have asked: Is that a rainbow on Mars? No. Rainbows aren't possible here.

              " ' May shoot down Chinese drones in South China Sea: Taiwan  Taiwan has spotted Chinese drones circling the Taipei-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea and may shoot them down if they stray too close, a government minister said on Wednesday, a move that could dramatically increase tensions with Beijing.Speaking at parliament, Lee Chung-wei, who heads the Ocean Affairs Council under whose purview the Coast Guard falls, said that they had recently spotted Chinese drones circling the Pratas, though they have not flown over the islands.\"They have never entered our restricted waters and airspace, they\\'ve just flown around them at a certain distance,\" Lee said.While China recognises no Taiwanese claims of sovereignty, its aircraft and ships generally stay outside Taiwan\\'s restricted zone, which extends 6 km from its coast.Asked how the Coast Guard would react if a Chinese drone entered that restricted zone, Lee said they had rules of engagement.\"After it enters it will be handled under the rules. If we need to open fire, we open fire.\"The Pratas lie at the top end of the disputed waterway, and have become a relatively new source of intrigue between Chinese-claimed Taiwan and Beijing.In recent months Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese air force activity near the islands, which Taiwan\\'s Coast Guard only lightly defends though there are periodic deployments of marines. There is no permanent civilian population, only occasional visiting scientists.In October, Hong Kong air traffic controllers warned off a Taiwanese civilian flight flying to the Pratas on a routine weekly supply run, forcing it to turn back.The Pratas, the closest Taiwan-controlled territory to Hong Kong, have also taken on extra significance since anti-government protests began in the Chinese-run city.Taiwan has intercepted at least one boat close to the Pratas carrying people fleeing from Hong Kong trying to make their way to Taiwan.Taiwan\\'s other main South China Sea island is Itu Aba, also known as Taiping Island, which is part of the Spratly archipelago.Lee said they have not spotted Chinese drones there.Apart from China and Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam also have competing claims for islands and features in the South China Sea.

Harbhajan, who missed the last season of IPL due to personal reasons was one of players released by Chennai Super Kings before the IPL auction.However, at the 2021 IPL auction, Harbhajan found a new home as KKR invested ₹2 crore on him. And judging by what Karthik makes of Harbhajan\\'s effort, the off-spinner is already hitting the top gear ahead of a fresh season with the little things, such as coming to practice before anyone else.\"Picking him I think wasn\\'t easy, considering that he has been around for so long. But the amount of interest and interest and intensity he has shown in the last one week is just fabulous,\" Karthik told KKR website. \"He has been coming to practice sessions early, much ahead of all other players, and he has been doing it consistently. I think he is a different man now from whatever little I have seen of him this week.\"At 40, Harbhajan comes into the IPL 2021 without any match practice. In fact, Harbhajan last played any form of competitive cricket in May of 2019, when CSK played the final against Mumbai Indians and lost by a narrow margin of one run. However, despite his age, Harbhajan is showing tremendous determination ahead of his maiden stint with KKR, which Karthik feels is inspiring.\"Even in a practice game that starts at 7 pm, he comes at 4 o\\'clock. He was batting before that, he bowled to Shakib (Al Hasan) and (Eoin) Morgan, and then did his stretching again before getting into the practice game,\" shared Karthik.\"He is bowling in the match and also fielding all 20 overs. That\\'s about as much as you can ask for from a man of his stature. He has achieved everything, yet to show this kind of interest at this stage of his career speaks volumes of him as a character. I am sure he will do a great job for KKR.\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics ipl 2021 kkr harbhajan singh dinesh karthik + 2 more ',\n",

              " ' China’s new way to support Xinjiang cotton: Blur out Western brand logos  Amid a huge backlash in China against Western fashion brands over Xinjiang cotton row, Chinese TV stations have found a new way to show support for the controversial way to produce cotton - blurring out Western brand logos in their programmes. According to a BBC report, the post-production editors of various shows are now censoring everything from T-shirts to shoes, leading to delay in some broadcasts.Last month, China launched a PR war on Western brands, including H&M, Nike and Adidas, that were critical of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region. The controversy kicked off after a due diligence report of H&M, released in October 2020, was recently translated and circulated on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.In the report, the Swedish clothing company had referred to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI)’s statement on cotton from Xinjiang. BCI, a non-profit group promoting sustainable cotton production, had announced the suspension of its activities, citing \"increasing risks\" of forced labour. H&M maintains on its website that it neither works with any garment manufacturing factories located in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) nor sources products from the region, one of the world\\'s top cotton-producing areas.Also Read | A statement by Nike, H&M on Uighurs. One year later, a backlash by BeijingThe stance of Western fashion retailers over rights abuses in Xinjiang triggered massive outrage on social media. Chinese celebrities jumped on the bandwagon and severed ties with Western brands to express support for Xinjiang cotton. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular briefing that Chinese people won’t allow “foreigners to eat China\\'s rice while smashing its bowls.”Blurring out brand logos on television programmes is the latest way to show support for Xinjiang cotton which, according to BBC, has led to “unintentionally funny results.” In episodes of the show ‘Sisters Who Make Waves’, the blurred out shoes of actors and singers give an impression as if they are floating on clouds. Blurred out shoes in \\'Sisters Who Make Waves\\'.(Weibo) Contestants of a reality show Chuang 2021 had worn clothes with Western logos from head to toe, eventually leaving no option for post-production editors other than blurring out entire bodies.Several leaked documents from China have revealed Beijing’s brutal and systematic crackdown on Uyghurs in which the officials have termed the action as a “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”. China has denied all of these allegations, claiming it has just taken these measures to lift Uighurs out of poverty. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics china xinjiang uygur autonomous region ',\n",

              " ' Sachin Vaze took orders directly from Param Bir Singh, says Mumbai CP’s report  Suspended assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze was posted in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) in June last year on the insistence of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh despite opposition from a top crime branch officer and reported directly to the former police chief, according to a report sent by Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to the Maharashtra government.According to the Mumbai police chief’s report seen by HT, Vaze bypassed protocol and hierarchy to directly report to Param Bir Singh who practically took all critical decisions relating to arrests, raids, remand applications and the police stand on anticipatory bail in cases handled by Sachin Vaze’s team.“Vaze used to accompany Param Bir Singh during the briefing to the minister, home, on critical cases including TRP scam, Antilia explosive scare, Dilip Chhabria’s arrest. Vaze never obeyed the hierarchy of ranks to report over the cases under investigation,” the document said.Also Read: Time to clean up Mumbai | HT EditorialParam Bir Singh did not respond to phone calls and text messages sent by HT for his response to the report. This news report will be updated when he gives his reaction.Officials said the police commissioner was told to send the report to the home department after Sachin Vaze’s arrest.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 for his alleged role in planting a vehicle with 20 loose gelatin sticks near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia. He is the prime suspect in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the vehicle found near Antilia. This case is also being investigated by the NIA.The police commissioner’s report, which is seen to link Param Bir Singh to the controversial police officer Sachin Vaze, immediately prompted calls to put the former city police chief’s role under scrutiny. On Wednesday, the NIA summoned Param Bir Singh for questioning in the two cases. Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said this was something they had been demanding for days, because of Param Bir Singh’s “close proximity” with arrested API Vaze.“It has now been established that Singh is as responsible as Vaze in these two cases,” the Congress leader said.Singh was removed as police commissioner on March 17 and shifted as commandant general of home guards. Param Bir Singh ignited a political storm soon after, with a letter to Uddhav Thackeray accusing the then home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption. Singh later approached the Supreme Court and high court too. On Monday, Deshmukh finally had to resign after the Bombay high court asked the CBI to hold a preliminary inquiry into the allegation.Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale’s report, sought by the home department while Deshmukh was still home minister, also links Param Bir Singh to the decision to revoke Sachin Vaze’s suspension.“The decision about the reinstatement of Vaze was taken in a suspension review committee meeting on June 5, 2020, chaired by Singh, joint police commissioner (administration) and other two senior officers. Vaze was reinstated on June 9 and was given posting in CIU, after initial appointment in the armed unit,” the report said, pointing that the then joint commissioner (Crime) had strongly opposed Vaze’s posting in the CIU.It said Param Bir Singh ensured that Vaze headed the CIU though he, unlike other police officers who led the crucial unit in the past, was not an inspector-rank officer.

              " ' China condemns 2 ex-Xinjiang officials on separatism charges  China has sentenced a former education official and a former legal official in the northwestern region of Xinjiang to death with a two-year reprieve on charges including separatism and bribe taking.Sattar Sawut and Shirzat Bawudun are the latest of many Xinjiang bureaucrats, almost all members of the Muslim Turkic Uyghur minority group, to be sentenced on national security charges in what China calls a campaign against “two-faced officials” who are seeking to undermine Chinese rule from within the system.Such sentences are usually commuted to life in prison after two years with good behavior. Both men pleaded guilty and neither would file an appeal, said Wang Langtao, vice president of Xinjiang\\'s regional higher people\\'s court.National security cases are heard behind behind closed doors and it wasn\\'t exactly clear when the men had been tried or when their sentences had been handed down. Sattar Sawut was detained in 2018. It was clear when Shirzat Bawudun had been held.The court on Tuesday said Sattar Sawut, the the former head of the regional education department, “incorporated ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism, and religious extremism content into minority-language textbooks.”“Sattar Sawut took advantage of compiling and publishing ethnic language textbooks for primary and secondary schools to split the country, starting in 2002.He instructed others to pick several people with separatist thoughts to join the textbook compilation team, the court found,\" the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing comments by Wang at a news conference.Wang said Shirzat Bawudun, the former head of the Xinjiang regional justice department, was convicted of “splitting the country\" for having colluded with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement and having “offered help to separatists and religious extremists, and collaborated with overseas separatist forces.\"The ETIM is listed as a terrorist group by the United Nations, although many experts question whether it exists in operational form.Shirzat Bawudun met with ETIM representatives and encouraged others to join the group, Wang said. He also “carried out illegal religious activities at his daughter\\'s wedding\" and accepted bribes totaling 11.12 million yuan (USD 1.7 million), Wang said.Following terror attacks that killed thousands, China launched a sweeping security campaign in Xinjiang, detaining more than 1 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and members of other minority Muslim groups in prison-like reeducation centers where they are told to denounce Islam and traditional culture, learn Mandarin Chinese and swear fealty to the ruling Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.That crackdown has been accompanied by the arrests of leading Uyghur academics and other public figures, mostly on charges of separatism.China denies any abuses, saying the centers were aimed at teaching job skills and deradicalizing those influenced by anti-Chinese jihadi teachings. It says its policies have prevented any new terrorist attacks taking place for more than four years.Beijing has also vociferously attacked claims of forced labor in factories and cotton fields and encouraged an unofficial public boycott of foreign companies that have spoken out on the matter.It calls US sanctions against officials associated with persecution in Xinjiang a former of political persecution that will have no effect on government policy.The court said textbooks approved by Sattar Sawut were used for 13 years, bringing “grave consequences.\" It said the 2003 and 2009 editions of the textbooks contained 84 passages preaching ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism and religious extremism and that several people were inspired by the books to participate in a bloody anti-government riot in the regional capital Urumqi in 2009.Others, the court said, became inspired to become “key members of a separatist group headed by former college teacher Ilham Tohti,\" a Uyghur economist serving a life sentence on a separatism charge since 2014.Sattar Sawut also abused his official positions to accept bribes worth 15.05 million yuan (USD 2.3 million), the court said.

              " ' The complicated calculus of traveling with kids during Covid  To the long list of ways that Covid-19 has changed travel, add this one: The kids’ club just doesn’t cut it anymore.Pre-2020, glorified daycare was almost an essential component of five-star family getaways. Kids could make origami butterflies or explore tide pools under the watchful eyes of resort staffers, while parents happily got re-acquainted with relaxation.But the pandemic has raised the bar on family travel. Consider a new offering from travel outfitter Black Tomato, best known for planning exotic adventures for upscale clients—now building entire itineraries around beloved children’s stories.The company’s new Take Me On a Story program is a fanciful step up from Harry Potter-themed walking tours. Its Oxfordshire trip, inspired by Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, includes a foraging class and a bespoke costume made by a top atelier, complete with hand-stitching and a fitting in a charming Cotswold cottage. Pricing starts at $45,000 for a family of four. As part of the Treasure Island itinerary in the British Virgin Islands (from $30,000 for four) kids can take lessons in sword-fighting and celestial navigation, and participate in an underwater treasure hunt. Other options explore Arabian Nights in Morocco, Journey to the Centre of the Earth in Iceland, and Call of the Wild in Alaska.Black Tomato co-founder Tom Marchant says the idea for Take Me On a Story dates back to 2019 but has taken time to come to fruition. Now, he says, is the perfect moment for it. “People are looking for genuine escapism,” he explains.Other high-end travel companies are also raring to satisfy those pandemic desires—and the willingness to splash out. After a year of lockdown, they’re launching lavish cruises, safaris, and itineraries, all aimed at travelers with children under 18.And yet, family travel has never been a more complicated proposition. Vaccines aren’t expected to be widely available to the under-16 set for several months, possibly not even until early 2022.Dr. Richard Malley, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist who runs the travel clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital, says teens may get vaccine access in the fall, “assuming everything looks good in the trials.” But those under 12 will need to wait longer. Nevertheless he’s seen an uptick in family travel consultations. Some patients are going to visit relatives living abroad. Others, Malley says, are going on exotic vacations like safaris, “the dream trips that families used to do” that went away.Assessing risksOn April 2, the same day the CDC announced that domestic travel is considered low risk for vaccinated people who continue to take precautions, the TSA screened nearly 1.6 million passengers. It was the most in one day since the pandemic began, and more than 10 times the throughput in April 2020.That indicates a gap between the CDC’s official stance—limiting non-essential travel pre-vaccine—and what people are doing. According to a report from travel-focused ad agency MMGY, the divide is pronounced among parents who make over $150,000: They plan to take 4.4 leisure trips over the next 12 months, compared to 3.3 trips for wealthy households sans-kids. Dr. Aaron Millstone, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, says Covid presents an extremely small threat to unvaccinated kids—but it’s not zero. Decisions come down, in part, to how comfortable you are with a potential positive for them and yourself. “Even though I’m vaccinated, if I get a mild Covid case, I can’t work for 10 days,” he explains. The risk of spreading the disease post-vaccine, however small, also still exists, particularly in destinations with poor vaccine access or uptake where locals may be more vulnerable. “It’s all an equation,” Dr. Malley says. “You’ve increased your risk here, so reduce it there.” Traveling in a private car—or private plane—comes with less risk than commercial flights, though a lack of testing and tracing among airlines has made the risk of flying difficult to assess.“There’s a lot of data to suggest that plane travel can be safe,” says Dr. Susan Coffin, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “But you could be the person who gets put in the middle of a row and have people coughing on your right and left.” (Even Delta is now selling middle seats.)Millstone suggests skipping food court meals at airports, going straight to the gate just before the flight, and wearing your mask throughout the trip.Even if you’re not concerned about contracting the virus, Malley recommends checking local Covid case counts wherever you go, not just to mitigate your family’s risk and avoid adding vectors of transmission, but to reduce potential strain on a burdened healthcare system—parents and children alike can still get injured or sick from non-Covid illnesses. “Would you want to be in a country where the medical system is in trouble?” he says.Making up for lost tripsMillstone says the wisest move is to wait, even just a month or two: “Most models are predicting that by summer, rates will have gone down.”Parents will have more high-end options then as well. Besides Black Tomato, boutique cruise company Uniworld just launched a “Christmas in July” series of trips, designed as a do-over for the 2020 holidays. The cruises will feature red-and-white decor, winter themed cocktails, and onboard holiday markets.In March, Ker & Downey Africa started selling 10-day private safaris specifically for families that includes visits to Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater, Serengeti National Park, and Selous Game Reserve. For $8,430 per person, clients have exclusive use of 4x4 vehicles, as well as safari camps and villas chosen for their child-friendliness. (Kids, lions, and luxury don’t always go hand in hand.) The itineraries respond to a marked an increase in East Africa requests from families, says Sarah Morris, sales manager of Ker & Downey Africa.The same holds true for Roar Africa, which recently introduced a Lion King-themed itinerary in South Africa, complete with themed children’s activities and, of course, the chance to spot all of the animals who featured in the film.“No one made their summer travel plans as far in advance as they usually do,” says Roar CEO Deborah Calmeyer. “Now they are ready—and they want to go big.”As for Black Tomato, the most extravagant trip of all may be the Call of the Wild journey in Alaska. During the nine-night experience, families can go on a kayaking safari and a custom survival course, as well as take a private helicopter to the top of a glacier, then spend the day learning how to drive a dog sled. The trip clocks in at almost $40,000 per person.“If children are lucky enough to go on these trips, it’s going to be not only inspiring but educative,” Marchant says. “And we’re trying to create something that adults will enjoy as well.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' Taiwan will fight \\'\\'to the very last day\\'\\' if China attacks  Taiwan\\'s foreign minister on Wednesday said the island will defend itself “to the very last day” if attacked by China.Joseph Wu said China\\'s attempts at conciliation while engaging in military intimidation are sending “mixed signals” to the island\\'s residents.China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be won over peacefully or by force.Wu noted China flew 10 warplanes into Taiwan\\'s air defense identification zone on Monday and deployed an aircraft carrier group for exercises near Taiwan.“We are willing to defend ourselves, that\\'s without any question,\" Wu told reporters. “We fill fight a war if we need to fight a war, and if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day, then we will defend ourselves to the very last day.“China does not recognize Taiwan\\'s democratically elected government, and leader Xi Jinping has said “unification” between the sides cannot be put off indefinitely.“On the one hand they want to charm the Taiwanese people by sending their condolences, but at the same time they are also sending their military aircraft and military vessels closer to Taiwan aimed at intimidating Taiwan\\'s people,\" Wu said at a ministry briefing.“The Chinese are sending very mixed signals to the Taiwanese people and I would characterize that as self-defeating,\" Wu said.The vast improvements in China\\'s military capabilities and its increasing activity around Taiwan have raised concerns in the U.S., which is legally bound to ensure Taiwan is capable of defending itself and to regard all threats to the island\\'s security as matters of “grave concern.\"China\\'s military said Monday the new naval drills were meant to help it \"safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,” terms often interpreted as being directed at Taiwan\\'s leadership that has refused to give in to Beijing\\'s demands that it recognize the island as part of Chinese territory.Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, and most Taiwanese favor maintaining the current state of de facto independence while engaging in robust economic exchanges with the mainland.China has also created conditions for greater economic integration, while also targeting some communities such as pineapple farmers in hopes of weakening their support for the island\\'s government.Chinese diplomatic pressure has been growing also, reducing the number of Taiwan\\'s formal diplomatic allies to just 15 and shutting its representatives out of the World Health Assembly and other major international forums.

              " ' Tokyo Olympic torch relay taken off streets of Osaka  The Tokyo Olympic torch relay will not run through the streets of Osaka prefecture next week because of rising COVID-19 cases.The move is a setback for Tokyo organizers, who began the relay two weeks ago from northeastern Fukushima prefecture with 10,000 runners planning to crisscross Japan over the course of four months.The Olympics open in just over 100 days on July 23.In a last-minute change of plans, organizers said in a statement Wednesday that runners and the torch will be involved in some event in an Osaka city park on the days when the relay was to cross the entire prefecture. That was to be April 13-14.“Given the circumstances, the Osaka prefectural authorities today requested Tokyo 2020 to hold the Osaka segment of the Olympic torch relay in Expo \\'70 Commemorative Park rather than on public roads,” Tokyo organizers said in a statement.The statement said the Osaka segment would be conducted in the park “for all torchbearers who wish to run there.” It also said “no spectators” would be admitted either day.The ordeal of keeping the relay on track reminds of the giant problems that are likely when the Olympics and Paralympics take place with a total of 15,400 athletes from more than 200 countries entering Japan. They will be joined by tens of thousands of other officials, judges, media and broadcasters.Fans from abroad are banned, and it is not yet clear how many local fans will be able to attend Olympic events. Tokyo organizing committee president Seiko Hashimoto promised a decision this month on venue capacity, but hinted last week that the announcement could be delayed.Ticket sales were to account for $800 million in revenue for the organizers, a large chunk but small compared to the official bill for the Olympics of $15.4 billion, most of which falls on Japanese taxpayers.Osaka prefecture Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura asked people on Wednesday not to make unnecessary trips in the area.“Medical systems (in Osaka) are on the verge of collapse,” Yoshimura said at a news conference, attributing the rapid spike in infections to new variants of the virus. “Obviously it spreads more rapidly and it is more contagious.\"About 70% of hospital beds available in Osaka have already been occupied, officials said.Osaka reported 719 new cases Tuesday and more than 800 were expected Wednesday, both exceeding totals for Tokyo. But there are also fears the spike will be seen soon in Tokyo.The vaccine rollout is extremely slow in Japan with very few people expected to be vaccinated when the Olympics begin. Japan has attributed about 9,300 deaths to COVID-19, which is good by world standards but poor by the standards in most Asian countries.

              " ' Sutradhara’s tales: Islamic powers conquer Deccan, Sufism arrives in Pune  The 13th century symbolises a vital change in the socio-political and cultural environment of Deccan, so much so that it was named as the Islamic or medieval period by colonial historians. In 1296, Ala-ud-din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate successfully raided Devagiri. Khalji restored it to Ramachandra in return of his promise of payment of a high ransom and an annual tribute. However, this was not paid and the Yadava kingdom’s arrears to Khalji kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by Malik Kafur, accompanied by Khwaja Haji, to Devagiri. Their huge army conquered the weakened and defeated forces of Devagiri almost without a battle. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra as governor in return for a promise to help him subdue the Hindu kingdoms in South India. Ramachandra’s successor Simhana III challenged the supremacy of Khalji, who sent Malik Kafur to recapture Devagiri in 1313. Simhana III was killed in the ensuing battle and Khalji’s army occupied Devagiri. Thus, the mighty Yadava Empire was completely annexed by the Khalji sultanate in 1317. Malik Kafur conquered most parts of Maharashtra, including Pune, thus bringing the significant Deccan territory under Islamic rule.In the year 1320s, the Tughluq Dynasty occupied the Delhi throne and shortly after in 1327, Muhammad bin Tughluq’s shifted his capital from Delhi to Deogiri.This period was the most productive period in the work and ideology of the early Sufi Shaikhs, who also became the guiding factor for later mystics and rulers.Propagation of the Sufi sect in Deccan was greatly supported by spread of political powers. It was around the same time, mysticism movement in Islam in the form of Sufism started growing and many Sufi saints travelled with their disciples for propagation of the sect. The devotional mysticism of the Bhakti movement in Deccan provided an ideological overlap with the Sufism, which led to syncretic practices accepted by Dakkhanis.Deccan provinces provided fertile grounds for development of medicine, astrology and trade, some of the primary Sufi interests. It was during this time, Shaikh Nizamuddin Avaliya with his 700 followers descended south to propagate the Sufi sect. One of his followers, Sheikh Sallauddin Gazi Chisti, alias Sheikh Salla (son of Sheikh Abdulla of Ghor), came down to Pune with his four followers from the Middle East and settled on the banks of the river Mutha near present day Shaniwar peth. Pune Pet Kafiyat, a Maratha period manuscript discovered by Dr Uday Kulkarni documents a rather peculiar tale related to Shaikh Sallauddin. The saint Sallauddin was camping in the Masjid gardens (now absent) near Kumbhar Ves. The Saint performed the miracle of raising the dead bullocks belonging to the grief-stricken gardener of the temple named Divekar. The delighted gardener informed the keeper of the fort Kondhana (then Sinhagad), Annaji Shirke about the astonishing miracle and invited him to visit Shaikh Avaliya. Ailing son and limbless daughter of Annaji were healed completely by Shaikh Avaliya’s touch and recitation of verses. This incident helped build the trust of locals in the immigrant group of Sufis. Shaikh Sallauddin’s death in the year 1358 was commemorated by his followers by forcibly converting the Yadav period Narayaneshwar temple into his memorial dargah.This dargah lies to the left of Shaniwanwada, along the river Mutha, and is popularly known as Thorla (senior) Shaikh Salla Dargah. When the temple of Narayaneshwar was demolished, the Vedic Brahmin priest of the temple Shyambhat Rajarshi (Kulkarnis of Pune) converted to the Islamic faith and became disciples of Shaikh Salla Avaliya. He requested his teacher to grant him religious rights as per Islam and Avaliya arranged for him to be appointed as Kazi of the town of Pune. The Kazi of Pune and Pirjadye of the Shaikh Salla dargah are the successors of Shyam Bhat. Further, Shyam Bhat was conferred Inam of Mauje Erandwane and Mauje Kalas villages for the management of the Sheikh Salla Dargah. The main tomb, which has a plain doorway, is approached by a flight of steps. The space inside is very uneven and is now a regular burial ground with numerous graves around the central tomb, which is a circular domed room. The ruins of the original Yadava period Narayaneshwar temple are still scattered about to the south-west of Sheikh Salla’s tomb. They consist chiefly of stone columns and lintels, some in their places and others strewn over the ground. A few years later, Sayyad Hisamuddin Kattal Zanjani (a religious advocate belonging to the sect of Makhdum Mit Ashraf Samnani), came to Pune and settled on its banks near Kumbhar Ves. Saint Hisamuddin died in 1390. Punyeshwar Temple on the banks of Mutha near Kumbharwada was brought down and converted into the memorial dargah of Shaikh Hisamuddin. This led the fleeing of priest of Punyeshwar with the Shiv-linga to the base of Purandar fort.Behind the mosque, a flight of steps lead from Punyeshwar’s temple to the river bed. Pillars of this temple match the pillars of Kasba Ganpati temple. In the front courtyard to the left is a tiled building where a bier or tabut is kept and where congregations are held for prayer.The domed structure on the tomb was added later. It is the second oldest dargah in Pune built after Thorla Shaikh Sallah Durgah. The campus of Dhakta Shaikh Salla also houses the memorial of Mohiul–milaat the grandson of Aurangzeb Badshah, son of Kambaksh. Aurangzeb was in Pune in 1702 during his south Indian campaign. Aurangzeb had named the city of Pune as Muhiyabad, in his own name; Muhi-ud-Din or to commemorate his grandson, Muhi-us- Sunnat, according to some scholars.Apart from the mosques’ religious significance, they have great historical and architectural importance and are a designated protected heritage site. The socio-political changes of the 14th century begin a new chapter in Pune’s life and it let to restructuring of the settlement of Pune, politically, culturally and spatially… SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' India\\'s air travel expected to double in next decade: Report  Aerospace major Boeing on Wednesday forecast strong aviation growth in India due to the country\\'s growing economy and an expanding middle class, fueling demand for more than 2,200 new jets valued at nearly 320 billion dollars over the next 20 years.Boeing shared its India forecast as part of its annual Commercial Market Outlook (CMO) which anticipates resilient long-term demand for commercial airplanes and services.Although the Covid-19 pandemic sharply reduced Indian air travel last year, the country\\'s domestic passenger traffic is recovering more rapidly than in most other countries and regions, recently reaching 76 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.India\\'s passenger market is the world\\'s third-largest. Its economy is predicted to grow at 5 per cent annually through the forecast period, the highest of any emerging market.While Covid-19 remains a near-term challenge, the country\\'s passenger traffic is forecast to outpace global growth, doubling from pre-pandemic levels by 2030, according to the CMO.India air cargo growth is expected to average 6.3 per cent annually over the next 20 years, driven by India\\'s manufacturing and e-commerce sectors.

              " ' Didi banks on Trinamool women brigade to stop BJP onslaught  Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has placed her faith in the party’s women brigade to stop the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) juggernaut in West Bengal. Be it fighting the alleged outsider force of BJP or becoming polling agents and manning booths on election days, Banerjee has urged the party’s women workers and supporters to come forward. “Don’t appoint any person as a polling agent who is scared. I want agents who won’t flee even in the face of threats. If you can’t find a suitable agent, make women the polling agents,” Banerjee has told her party workers at a public rally on Tuesday, adding that four to five agents fled during the third phase polls on April 6. The party chief’s directive came after some agents refused to go to the booths in the face of alleged threats while some others abandoned their posts on the polling day in the three phases of elections. BJP rubbished the allegations, saying that voting was free and fair in Nandigram and there was a huge voter turnout. Nandigram recorded 88.01% voter turnout. “After the first two phases, she has come to know that defeat is imminent. That is why she is making such statements. This is her last minute efforts. But people of Bengal have made up their mind. Such tactics won’t work anymore,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson. Also Read | BJP internal assessment: Nandigram a contestOn April 1, when Nandigram went to polls, an elderly woman cried on camera that she didn’t let her son, a TMC polling agent at a Boyal booth, to go to the polling station after the family was threatened. Referring to all these incidents, Banerjee said at an election rally in Hooghly’s Khanakul on Sunday, “I am not ready to listen to excuses like BJP’s threats or BJP’s attacks. I am asking you to depute women as polling agents in a booth. Assign Kanyashree girls, who are getting scholarships and are at least 18, as polling agents.” This is, however, not the first time that the TMC chief has urged women party workers to come forward. Banerjee had earlier too assigned them bigger roles, saying that they should hit the roads with kitchen utensils and broomsticks to counter the BJP. “The BJP is bringing in goons from outside the state. I will urge the women to come out with ‘hata and khunti’ (kitchen utensil) and confront the goons. Wipe them away with your broomsticks,” she said, adding that women would be in the front while men would form the second line of defence. With an eye on women voters and to sharpen its ‘outsider’ charge against the BJP, the TMC launched its main campaign slogan of Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay (Bengal wants its own daughter) ahead of the polls. West Bengal has around 37.3 million male voters, while there are around 35.9 million female voters in the state. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the participation rate of women voters in Bengal was as high as 81.7%. The state government has quite a few welfare schemes for women, including the Kanyashree scheme which aims at promoting education and prevent child marriages by using cash incentives. The BJP, however, took a dig at the TMC’s move, claiming that that the party was finding it hard to get polling agents. The jibe came from Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public rally. “The situation is such that Didi’s party is not getting polling agents for booths. Earlier also, she blamed the election commission and central forces for stopping her polling agents. But now, she is publicly accepting that her polling agents have started revolting against her. Actually, TMC workers are being pressured by their own mothers and sisters at home to quit the party which has been looting poor people and shedding their blood. The anger within the party is increasing,” Modi said while addressing a rally in Howrah on Tuesday. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb tests positive for Covid-19  Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday in an antigen test. The result of the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction or RT-PCR test to confirm the infection was yet to arrive, said officials. “I have been tested positive for Covid-19. I have isolated myself at home as per the advice of doctors. I request everyone to please follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour and stay safe,” Deb tweeted.West district health surveillance officer Dr Sangeeta Chakraborty said, “His (Deb’s) samples tested positive in antigen test. The samples were sent for RT-PCR test for reconfirmation.” The result of the test was expected to arrive later today.RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of Covid-19 testing due to its high sensitivity and accuracy, while antigen tests are generally deployed for mass testing and can quickly detect true positive cases. Two members of Deb’s family tested Covid-19 positive in August last year. The state has so far reported 33,554 Covid-19 cases, including 389 deaths, while a total of 33,069 patients have recovered from the disease, taking the recovery rate to 98.63%.

              " \" EU agency to share results of probe into AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot  The European Union's medicines regulator will announce the conclusions of its investigation into the possible connection between AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine and rare blood clots later Wednesday.Earlier this week, a senior official from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, said there was a causal link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the rare blood clots that have been seen in dozens of people worldwide, among the tens of millions who have received at least one dose.Marco Cavaleri, head of health threats and vaccine strategy at the Amsterdam-based agency, said in comments to Rome’s Il Messaggero newspaper on Tuesday that “it is becoming more and more difficult to affirm that there isn’t a cause-and-effect relationship between AstraZeneca vaccines and the very rare cases of blood clots associated with a low level of platelets.”But Cavaleri acknowledged the agency hadn't yet figured out how exactly the vaccine might be causing these rare side effects. The agency said its evaluation “has not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing.”The EMA, World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against Covid-19 outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots.Last week, the EU medicines regulator said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population,” though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected, and it would continue to assess incoming data.In March, more than a dozen countries, including Germany, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the European Medicines Agency said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine.But the frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine has raised concerns that AstraZeneca's credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic.In Britain, which has given out more doses of AstraZeneca vaccine than any other country, the medicines regulator reported there were 22 reports of rare brain and other clots, including people who had a low blood platelet level, among more than 18 million who got at least one dose.Any further doubts about the AstraZeneca vaccine would be a setback for the shot, which is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries.The AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper and easier to use than rival vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna and has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics astrazeneca \",\n",

              " \" Leaders of Russia and China tighten their grips, grow closer  They're not leaders for life — not technically, at least. But in political reality, the powerful tenures of China's Xi Jinping and, as of this week, Russia's Vladimir Putin are looking as if they will extend much deeper into the 21st century — even as the two superpowers whose destinies they steer gather more clout with each passing year.What's more, as they consolidate political control at home, sometimes with harsh measures, they're working together more substantively than ever in a growing challenge to the West and the world's other superpower, the United States, which elects its leader every four years.This week, Putin signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036. The 68-year-old Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — pushed through a constitutional vote last year allowing him to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends. He has overseen a systematic crackdown on dissent.In China, Xi, who came to power in 2012, has imposed even tighter controls on the already repressive political scene, emerging as one of his nation's most powerful leaders in the seven decades of Communist Party rule that began with Mao Zedong's often-brutal regime.Under Xi, the government has rounded up, imprisoned or silenced intellectuals, legal activists and other voices, cracked down on Hong Kong's opposition and used security forces to suppress calls for minority rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia.Xi has sidelined rivals, locked up critics and tightened the party's control over information. An ongoing crackdown against corruption has won popular support while also keeping potential competitors in line.His steady consolidation of power led to the removal of term limits on the Chinese presidency in 2018, demolishing a convention the party had established to prevent a repeat of the abuse produced by Mao's one-person rule.Xi further telegraphed his intention to remain in power by breaking from tradition and not indicating a preferred successor.One who appeared eager to take on the role, Sun Zhengcai, was brought down in 2017 and sentenced to life in prison on corruption charges.And in Russia, Putin's most outspoken critic, Alexei Navalny, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — an accusation Russian authorities have denied. In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2½ years in prison.In defying the West, Putin and Xi both have tapped nationalist feelings. Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea propelled Putin's approval ratings to nearly 90 per cent before they slackened amid economic woes and unpopular pensions reform.But the impact of Putin's and Xi's enduring retention of power hardly ends at their respective nations' borders. It ripples outward into the geopolitical balance of power in countless ways.As Moscow's relations with the West sank to post-Cold War lows amid accusations of election meddling and hacking attacks, Putin has increasingly sought to strengthen ties with China.And while China so far has avoided a showdown with the West like Russia's, it is coming under growing pressure from Washington and its allies over Beijing's human rights record in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.U.S. President Joe Biden has taken an increasingly tough line with both leaders, recently describing Putin as a “killer” and having his top national security aides excoriate China for a litany of issues.Such approaches suggest that Moscow and Beijing will have incentives to build an even stronger alliance.Like their nations, the two leaders themselves have fostered a closer relationship, too.Putin and Xi have developed strong personal ties to bolster a “strategic partnership” between the two former Communist rivals as they vie with the West for influence.And even though Moscow and Beijing in the past rejected the possibility of forging a military alliance, Putin said last fall that such a prospect can't be ruled out entirely.While both Putin and Xi each appear to be firmly entrenched, numerous challenges persist. The pandemic, for one, posed a major challenge for both rulers, and they took a similarly cautious approach when it struck.Putin responded last spring by introducing a sweeping six-week lockdown that severely hurt the already weak Russian economy. His approval rating plummeted to a historic low of 59%. Later, the government eased restrictions and steered clear from new lockdowns, helping reduce economic damage and shore up Putin's ratings.Xi remained out of the public eye in the first uncertain weeks, possibly fearing that any misstep could have given rivals a chance to topple him. In the end, China controlled the pandemic better than many other places, enhancing Xi's position as leader.Xi must also figure out how to satisfy ambitious young politicians who may see their careers being stymied by his lengthy tenure. And he has to demonstrate that his extended rule will not lead to the excesses of the Mao years, especially the disastrous and deeply traumatic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.“Xi has to manage an essential paradox. He venerates Mao and is building the same cult of personality and centrality of the party,” said Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

              " \" Dr. Shankar Iyer advocates smiling every day to live longer  Dr. Shankar Iyer says studies have shown that smiling increases the lifespan of an individual. It has a lot of psychological and emotional impact not only on the person but also the ones who see them smiling. One needs to think of smiling as a social activity to boost the image, confidence, appeal, morale, and happiness.It has been shown that smiling enables the release of endorphins, a mood-lightening hormone that makes feelings happier. When people see others smile, they associate it with a pleasing personality. It is someone who possesses an innate amicable nature and radiates inner beauty. It is impossible to sport a smile when you are sad, unhappy, and angry. A smile is a natural marker of a person’s emotional status that can only be elicited through an involuntary activation of the chemicals of the central nervous system.Research has shown that low self-esteem, depression, social awkwardness, and lack of confidence all have a direct correlation with missing teeth in the esthetic zone of a smile.“Keep your Teeth for Life '' is the motto that Dr. Shankar Iyer, a prominent Prosthodontist, who specializes in teeth replacement and dental implants utilizes in his lectures. Dr. Iyer’s approach has attracted several dentists all over the world to rethink how dentistry should be practiced. Whenever one visits the dentist, it is always associated with pain and the fear of being hurt. This paranoia can be overcome if preventive visits are made early on in one’s life.To enable one to have a healthy smile, one should look into Dr. Iyer’s educational programs that focus on maintaining the teeth for a perfect smile. “Ageing and tooth loss are not related so there should be no reason why one should keep losing teeth as we grow old”. Dr. Iyer does not promote active replacements with prostheses even though he is a Prosthodontist. He is a strong proponent of keeping maintainable teeth so their function can be extended. Dental implants preside over the failure of maintenance of teeth. It is far less expensive to go to a dentist to maintain one’s oral health than to have an expensive implant replacement.According to Dr. Iyer brushing twice a day with a non-abrasive toothpaste can make teeth shine for decades with the right approach. “Unwarranted cosmetic interventions for the sake of vanity may cause irreversible damage”, he cautions. If one needs cosmetic correction the dentist will evaluate you thoroughly and will lay out all options, provide benefits and risks and create a custom plan to enhance the smile.Through his courses, Dr. Iyer has been able to change the lives of dentists and patients. With a revolutionary thought process that addresses the etiology of the problem and is not directly treated with solutions, Dr. Iyer has consistently been chosen as one of New Jersey’s top dentists by his peers.Smile USA Foundation is the charitable organization founded by R. Iyer that provides free oral prosthesis to needy patients and even dental implants are being offered at no charge to those who are debilitated and are not able to afford expensive implants.Dr. Shankar Iyer is the first Asian to serve as the President of the oldest dental implant organization– the American Academy of Implant Dentistry. He is also a Fellow of several prestigious Academies including the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons (Glasgow) and the Greater New York Academy of Prosthodontists. Maintaining a private practice in New Jersey and teaching at Rutgers University School of dental medicine, he travels to India to do advanced courses and conducts training programs that are only available in the US. His passion for education benefited over 3000 dentists.Dr. Iyer is working with Reliance Foundation Hospital to set up advanced courses through which dentists are certified by American Universities. Mr. Mukesh Ambani has supported these educational ventures offered by Smile USA through HNH Reliance Foundation. He credits a lot of success of these programs to Chairman and CEO Mr. Ambani who has extended extensive academic and institutional support. Numerous patients who are suffering from undiagnosed pain and joint dysfunction are being treated successfully through these programs at the hospital.Disclaimer: This is a company press release.

              " ' IPL 2021: From Rashid Khan to Varun Chakravarthy - 5 spinners to watch out for  The Indian Premier League is back home with IPL 2021. The 2020 season took place in the UAE in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The strips in the Gulf country did provide some assistance to spinners. However, with IPL making a comeback to Indian pitches, expect the spinners to go hard at the batsmen with all guns blazing.Spinners tend to go for runs in T2OIs, especially leg spinners, but that also provides them with a greater opportunity to take wickets. More often than not, spinners are brought on with the field spread to make inroads and at times stem the run-flow.South Africa bowling great Shaun Pollock once said that \"a dot ball in Twenty20 cricket is like gold\". Well, expect a lot of those in the upcoming 14th edition of the annual tournament.ALSO READ: Will Indian pitches help fast bowlers in this IPL?Before they spin their web, deceive the batsmen with variations, let\\'s glance through some of the spinners to watch out for in IPL 2021:Rahul Chahar: The leg-spinner\\'s return to the Indian T20I squad--during the India vs England series--bears testament to his rise and improvement. Rahul Chahar has been a key member of Mumbai Indians\\' spin department since the 2019 season. Last year during IPL 2020 in the UAE, Chahar made great use of the conditions and picked 15 wickets in as many matches. He stemmed the run-flow in the middle overs and provided his side with crucial breakthroughs. In 2019, he bagged 13 wickets. Overall, Chahar has 30 wickets to his name after 31 IPL matches. He comes into this tournament high on confidence from an impressive Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he took 11 wickets in 5 matches. He is one of the finds of the IPL and the defending champions will continue to bank on his exploits to earn another record-breaking feat.Rashid Khan: You know you are a very, very good bowler if batsmen give you respect in a T20 game. Afghanistan\\'s Rashid Khan, without a shred of a doubt, is one of the most dangerous bowlers in the Indian Premier League currently. The Sunrisers Hyderabad spinner, since his debut IPL season in 2017, Rashid has impressed one and all with his mastery, deception, variations. In the last season, he was the sixth-highest wicket-taker with 20 wickets in 16 matches, including the best bowling spell of 3/7. He was the second-most successful spinner in the edition, one behind Yuzvendra Chahal. With IPL returning to India, Rashid Khan is expected to be his at economical best. In 62 IPL matches, he has pocketed 75 wickets at a stellar economy rate of 6.24. Last year, he went for less than six an over (5.37).ALSO READ | \\'He said I will get better with experience\\': T Natarajan recalls MS Dhoni\\'s advice ahead of IPL 2021Yuzvendra Chahal: There is no way one can talk about spinners in the IPL without mentioning Royal Challengers Bangalore\\'s Yuzvendra Chahal. The leg-spinner, heading into his 9th season, has almost become a veteran of sorts. With 121 IPL career wickets in 99 games, Chahal is placed ninth in the all-time highest wicket-takers list. He was the best spinner in the previous edition with 21 wickets in 15 matches with a healthy economy rate of 7.08. He finished as the franchise\\'s most successful bowler in 2019, picking 18 wickets in 14 games. To put his consistency into context, the Indian spinner has not finished lower than 2nd in the wickets tally for RCB since 2015. Even though he had a subdued T20I series against England and didn\\'t get picked for the ODIs, he continues to remain an extremely crucial member of the side.R. Ashwin: What a past few months this man is having. A breakthrough of sorts tour of Australia where he played a memorable innings alongside Hanuma Vihari to save the Sydney Test. Back home against England, he was taking five-wicket hauls at will to go with another Test century on home ground in Chennai. Delhi Capitals\\' R. Ashwin is likely to lead the spin attack of the franchise. He will have Axar Patel for company, who is currently on cloud nine after a dream debut series against England. Another bowler who picked up five-wicket hauls at will. Ashwin recently stated his desire to play white-ball cricket for India. While many pundits and former players have reduced him to a Test specialist, Ashwin\\'s skills are still as good as any when it comes to limited-overs cricket. Last season, despite sitting out a few games due to a shoulder injury, he returned with 14 wickets from 15 matches. In the 11 seasons he has played so far, the Tamil Nadu all-rounder has bagged 138 wickets in 154 matches. He is currently the sixth-highest wicket-taker in the league\\'s history.Varun Chakravarthy: Due to outstanding figures of 17 wickets in 13 matches during his first full-fledged IPL season in UAE, the Tamil Nadu leg spinner Varun Chakravarthy became an essential part of the team. He has several variations up his sleeve and was picked up by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2020 to beef up their spin bowling department and he delivered. This earned him his maiden India call-up for the Australian Tour but he missed out due to an injury. Earlier this year, he was picked for the T20I series against England but he didn’t make the cut eventually as he failed to clear the fitness test multiple times. This decision sparked a raging debate on social media, with former cricketers and pundits criticizing the management for being too strict. Varun has a chance to force the issue by having an even better IPL. With greater assistance from Indian pitches, the sky is the limit for Varun.

The manner in which the 400-strong Maoist battalion No. 1 led by Madvi Hidma, chief of the Maoist party’s Central Military Commission, reportedly lured security forces into a trap and directly encountered them with assault rifles, rocket-launchers and fusillade of grenades, showed that the Maoists have not only grown in strength in some respects, but also gained the technical knowledge to fight a direct battle with the security forces, according to experts who have followed the trajectory of left-wing extremism. “The Maoists may have suffered heavy losses over a period of time, but have bounced back every time with the support of the Adivasis in the forests of Chhattisgarh,” said Ginugu Narasimha Reddy alias Jampanna, a former central committee member of Maoist party and head of its military commission in Chhattisgarh, before he surrendered to the Telangana police in December 2017. He said the fact that the Maoists could vacate the villages around the encounter spot within 20-30 minutes before the attack on the security forces,which would not have been possible without the support of the local people. “They have developed a strong information network,” Jampanna said. But how have the Maoists continued to retain their strength — if not wholly, then substantially — despite setbacks and a strong government offensive, especially in the south Chhattisgarh belt? The answer lies in returning to the past and tracing the evolution of the rebellion both in Chhattisgarh and its neighbouring regions. The Andhra experience Before 2005, the Nallamala forests encompassing Telangana and Andhra districts was an impregnable fortress of Maoists (who were earlier known as People’s War Group). This was more or less similar to the present Abujhmad region of Chhattisgarh, with police forces hardly having any access to the area. The killing of security forces and Maoists in exchange of fire was a routine affair. Also Read | Maoists cross a red line, again | HT EditorialAfter the lifting of the ban on Maoists and talks between the rebels and the then YS Rajasekhar Reddy government in combined Andhra Pradesh in October 2004, things changed in favour of the security forces. Talks failed despite initiatives of civil society groups, but it gave an opportunity to the security forces to access the Nallamala forests to help gain complete control over the region. After the failure of talks, the Greyhounds, a specialised force, and other security forces launched an all-out attack on Maoists, based on pointed intelligence, and inflicted heavy casualties. Top Maoist leaders, including Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna and Sudhakar, who took part in the talks, fled to Chhattisgarh and Andhra-Odisha borders. Many other top leaders such as Madhav, Shyam, Mahesh, Murali, Chandramouli, Prasad, Patel Sudhakar Reddy and Sakhamuri Appa Rao were killed in encounters. And some other central committee members such as Kobad Ghandy and Malla Raji Reddy were arrested from different parts of the country. “Between 2004 and 2009, nearly 400 Maoists, including top leaders and state secretaries were killed in encounters. The Nallamala forests were liberated from Maoists,” a senior police official, who played an active role in the talks with the Maoists in 2004, said. The implementation of a socio-economic agenda, coupled with effective police action and field level intelligence, led to the decline in Maoist activity in the then unified Andhra Pradesh after 2005. The setting up of tribal welfare residential schools even in the remotest areas, setting up of health care centres in every panchayat, development of road infrastructure to interior villages, various other programmes through Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDA) and implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme also helped lead to the decline in Maoist activities in Telangana and Andhra districts, bordering Chhattisgarh and Odisha. “Young people are not inclined towards Maoists anymore and have become career-oriented. They are looking towards towns and cities, rather than jungles,” observed S Venkatesh, an NGO activist in Bhadrachalam. Renewed focus on Chhattisgarh After facing reverses in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, the Maoists began consolidating their position in Chhattisgarh. Although they entered in Chhattisgarh in early 1980s, the region was initially used only as a buffer zone, but since the 1990s, the rebels stepped up their offensive against security forces. “Geographically, the Maoists have found Chhattisgarh forests very convenient to gain hold, compared to Telangana and Andhra. They could easily gain the support of the local Adivasis, who were agitated over the plundering of mineral wealth by the big companies with the support of the governments,” Jampanna, the former Maoist leader, said. Also Read | Maoists issue statement, say their fight not against security forcesThere were other factors that enabled the rise of Maoists in the region. According to senior police officials, the development strategy adopted by the combined Andhra government (and later Telangana government) did not work out in Bastar district due to a vacuum in administration and poor penetration of developmental agencies. “The massive corruption in the lower-rung revenue and forest officials also led to alienation of tribals,” a police official said. Chhattisgarh was also a newly formed state (it was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000) and had limited police strength — there were just about 1,000 policemen in undivided Bastar district. Unlike the Greyhounds of Andhra, the police personnel in Bastar were initially not trained adequately to fight the guerrilla warfare of Maoists. And then there was the Salwa Judum experiment, which, by all independent accounts, only deepened alienation among tribal communities in the region and led to human rights violations, providing a fertile ground to the Maoists to recruit and spread their ideology. The Salwa Judum was essentially a counter-insurgency group formed from within Adivasis to take on the Maoists. It was supposed to be a peace mission, and was launched by Mahendra Karma, a former Communist-turned-Congress leader in June 2005. The failed Judum experiment Projected as spontaneous uprising of tribals against the violence unleashed by Maoists, the Judum comprised mostly local Koya or Dorla tribes, who are believed to be semi-urban, compared to Muriya or Gothikoya tribes, who live deep inside the forests. While the Gothikoyas had become supporters of Maoists, the Koyas were exploited by the security forces in the name of Salwa Judum. Between 2005 and 2010, 644 tribal villages were evacuated and 100,000 brought into the Salwa Judum camps and provided with arms by the police to counter the Maoists. This led to massive armed conflicts between Salwa Judum tribals and Maoists, leading to countless deaths. The Salwa Judum experiment failed subsequently and it had to be wound up following a direction from the Supreme Court in July 2011. Its founder Mahendra Karma was brutally killed by Maoists on May 25, 2013. Also Read | Maoists release photograph of missing CoBRA commandoAfter the failure of Salwa Judum experiment, the Maoists stepped up their recruitment drive. Top Maoists leaders, mostly from Telangana, mingled with the local tribals and assimilated their distinct culture and tradition.The Maoists also started taking care of the needs of the tribals in the deep forests by setting up Janatana Sarkars (people’s governments) in the tribal hamlets, which are essentially local self-governments – they set up schools and banks run by local tribals, created irrigation facilities by constructing check dams on local streams, introduced collective farming and run revenue administration. “For the tribals, the Maoists are the real government, since they have not seen any other official coming to them so far. Naturally, they are prepared to lay down their lives for Maoists and fight with the police forces,” a teacher in a Bastar village, who did not want to be named, said. The absence of roads and bridges on rivers like Indrawati and its tributaries like Chintavagu and Sabri also helped Maoists isolate villagers for over six months in a year, thus giving them opportunity to “brainwash” the tribals. At the same time, the Chhattisgarh Police did not have a specialised anti-Naxal force like the greyhound of Telangana, while Maoists were able to create a specialised army in the form of PLGA with batallions, companies and platoons. Its approach of winning over tribals was coupled with coercion, which took the form of direct attacks on security forces and political leaders, as well as a reign of coercion over people in areas they controlled. The most significant Maoist attack on security forces was when they killed 76 CRPF personnel near Chintalnar village in Dantewada on April 6, 2010. A month later, they killed 36 persons, including 12 special police officers in an attack on a bus at Dantewada and 26 more CRPF jawans at Narayanpur on June 29, 2010. A timeline of the most significant Maoist attack on security forces. (HT Graphics) Earlier, they had killed 55 armed Salwa Judum forces and policemen at Rani Bodli in Bijapur on March 15, 2007 and 30 policemen, including Rajnandagaon superintendent of police, at Madanwada on July 12, 2009. In 2013, in one of their most audacious attacks, the Maoists wiped out almost the entire top leadership of the Congress in the state in an attack in Jiram Ghati, killing senior Congress leaders such as Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and VC Shukla. In the meantime, Operation Green Hunt, which was believed to have launched in November 2009 by the Central government simultaneously in five states — Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal — but was never officially confirmed, played a role in containing the Maoist movement to a large extent, but it did not completely weaken the left-wing extremism as these attacks showed.The response from RaipurOfficials believe that the Raman Singh government was more aggressive in tackling Maoists, with a higher number of anti-Naxal operations planned by the police and Central forces during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rule. But this, civil liberties activists claim, was accompanied by greater human rights violations. In 2014, a controversial Inspector General SRP Kalluri was posted in Bastar. While human rights activists alleged that the violation of human rights was at its peak during Kalluri’s tenure, his supporters lauded him as a superhero in containing Maoist activity — and spoke of his strategy of forcing the surrender of Maoists and enhancing the state’s penetration in rural areas. He was subsequently removed from Bastar in 2017. The Congress government, led by Bhupesh Baghel, which succeeded the Raman Singh government in December 2018, has claimed that the Maoist violence in the state has gone down. There are two views on this decline. On one hand are officials in the field who believe that the decrease in violence in 2019 and 2020 because of the reduced engagement of security forces in core areas with Maoists and “defensive strategy” of forces in the last two years. On the other side of the debate are senior police officials who claim this decline is because of a set of measures — including “offensive and intelligence-based operations” by state police and other paramilitary forces; the opening up of new operational base camps in the affected areas which has helped the police regain control over more than 8,000sqkm area in Bastar Range; and policies and programmes to provide employment to tribals of Bastar. The dip in Maoist strength According to official figures tabled in the Chhattisgarh state assembly during the recent budget session, there has been a decline in the encounters in the state – from 211 in 2016 to 198 in 2017, 166 in 2018, 121 in 2019 and 84 in 2020. The Maoists have made a tactical retreat due to stepping up of combing operations. “The Maoists were also short of funds due to lockdown and demonetisation, and thus wanted road construction and other activities to continue in lieu of levy, so there is a marked decrease in arson,” said an IPS officer posted in Bastar. A section of intelligence officials believe that the death of key Maoist leaders like Ramanna due to medical illness and poor health of other ageing top Maoists working in the state have decreased their mobility, thus leading to a vacuum, especially at the level of strategists. Top leaders are not able to move freely as in the past. However, despite the widespread sense that the Maoist forces have weakened, the PLGA remains strong. “They still have more than 1,000 automatic weapons looted from policemen,” a senior police official said. In the last two years, two serious incidents — the Minpa attack in 2020 and Tarrem in 2021 — occurred when forces were in operations. The PLGA forces rehearsed their ambush plans many times, and when forces arrived, they rearranged themselves in very short time, thus surprising security forces. “Although Maoists are now not in a position to attack police camps and police stations as they did in past, they still possess the capability to ambush security forces in their core areas due to their terrain knowledge, village support, civil recce teams leaking all movements of security forces and their fearless lightening attacks,” the police official said. Is there a way out? After Saturday’s encounter at Bijapur, Union home minister Amit Shah who called on the injured CRPF jawans at Jagdalur and Raipur declared that the Centre would decisively crush the Maoist movement. Experts offer different prescriptions.Ramesh Kanneganti, a Hyderabad-based internal security expert and executive director of Centre for Human Security Studies, said, “There is an urgent need to work on more robust state-level and Central-level multi-agency coordination to achieve greater operational and strategic alignment to weed out Maoists. National security and human security approaches should be blended to liquidate the menace with more emphasis on technology and human intelligence merger.”Professor G Hara Gopal, rights activist and former professor of Hyderabad Central University, who played a major role in the AP government-Maoist talks in 2004, said the whole problem lies in the Central government dealing with the issue as a “law-and-order problem, instead of socio-economic problem.” “As long as the government follows this path, the problem is going continue for a long and there is going to be loss of human life on both sides. This is very unfortunate. There is a need to engage Maoists in dialogue and the government should try to resolve the fundamental issues being raised by them,” he said. He added that there was also a need for a vibrant civil society which should take the initiative in bringing about a dialogue between the government and the Maoists. “Before the 2004 talks, there was a big exercise by such civil society groups, including former IAS officer S R Sankaran. Now, there is no such atmosphere in Chhattisgarh,” he regretted. Irrespective of what approach the government adopts, or the mix of strategies it weaves together, the battle against Maoists is entering a new phase in India. The past offers lessons.

Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan resorted to semantics in the health ministry’s briefing on Tuesday, saying “the aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it, but to those who need it”.“It is a common question that is being asked these days that why are not Covid-19 vaccinations being opened for all; why can’t all adults be given it. To those, I want to say that Covid-19 vaccination drive is essentially meant to serve two purposes: to prevent deaths and the other purpose is to protect your health care system. In the middle of a pandemic, the main aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it.

              " \" Abhishek humbly responds to woman who says 'bar set by' Scam 1992 is unmatchable  Abhishek Bachchan believes in killing ‘em with kindness. He humbly responded to a Twitter user who suggested that no one can live up to the high standard set by the team of Scam 1992. The nine-episode series, directed by Hansal Mehta and starring Pratik Gandhi in the lead role, is based on the life of scam-tainted stockbroker Harshad Mehta. Abhishek’s next release, The Big Bull, is inspired by the same subject.“No wonder why one can never match the bar set by team #Scam1992 .. no unwanted rap song, only theme music.. no unnecessary drama, to the point writing.. and most important is the flavour ‘Gujarati ke upar kahani banane wala, act karnewala, direct karnewala ... Sab Gujarati’ (The ones who brought to life the story of a Gujarati - the actor and director - are Gujarati too),” a woman tweeted.Replying to her, Abhishek mentioned his love for Gujarati food and said that his manager is also Gujarati. “Hey, just came across this tweet. I’ve acted in #TheBigBull does it count if I love Gujarati food and my favourite restaurant is @gordhan_thal in Amdavad? Plus my manager is also Gujarati..... please say yes,” he wrote on Twitter. Hey, just came across this tweet. I’ve acted in #TheBigBull does it count if I love Gujarati food and my favourite restaurant is @gordhan_thal in Amdavad?

The film is getting a direct-to-digital release on Disney+ Hotstar on April 8, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.In an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Abhishek pointed out that while Scam 1992 was a web series that was stretched out over nine episodes, The Big Bull is a film. He said that while it is 'understandable' why people are drawing similarities between the two projects, the film takes a different approach to telling the story.

              " ' Night curfew to contain Covid-19 spike, puts wedding celebrations in crisis  One would imagine ticking off the last-minute wedding tasks, preparing for the celebrations for their big day but couples planning to tie the knot this month are in a bind following the imposition of night curfew from 10pm to 5am in Delhi and 8pm to 7am in Mumbai, to stem Covid-19 in both cities.While some have decided to postpone the date again, others are weighing alternate solutions, with day weddings being touted as one. “The moment it was announced, we received a call from the venue to move the function to the day, but it might be difficult,” says Saurabh Aswal, an IT professional who is getting married on April 25. Another groom-to-be, Akhil Narang, a businessman, shares, “It is a state of chaos. The date is so near and the venues are saying they need to check the availability for day timings. We have already given ‘minimum guarantee’ to the venues but now with the option of day function, they’re not willing to reduce the cost. They need to understand that not all the guests will be able to attend in day time.”It is proving to be an equal drawback for couples who decided to skip the wedding venues in the Capital due to a cap on maximum guests to 100 and 200 and opted for venues in NCR, as now commuting and returning before the curfew timings may be of a concern. For Abhishek Pateria, a research scholar, who took two months off from his work in Poland for his wedding and booked a venue in Surajkund, Haryana, changes will be tough. “There’s no chance of postponing as I have to fly back or even switching to day functions due to shubh muhurat. It will be difficult for guests who will attend the wedding all the way from Delhi or Noida,” he says. Over the last year, wedding venues have started to observe the change in preferences of couples due to pandemic. Shivan Gupta , creative director, Amaara Farms says, “We have been receiving queries from couples for a brunch or moving towards day weddings, and also noticing the conscious efforts from our clients to keep their gathering intimate.”Not just the couples and venues but other wedding vendors such as planners and photographers are in conflict as well about last-minute refunds, cancellations and postponement challenges. Vishal Punjabi, founder and director, The Wedding Filmer, says, “There have been a few cancellations because family members have contracted Covid-19.” However, he feels that when things like this happen, it teaches us to value what we have. “Now isn’t the time to party and a wedding doesn’t have to be a big party,” he adds.As couples are navigating through the challenges to find an alternate solution, “They are taking suggestions to navigate the best possible ways to go ahead since so many vendors are involved. It has a lead to a lot of chaos and disturbance in the planning done so far. Due to very limited auspicious dates this year, the clients are not too convinced with the idea of even postponing the weddings,” says cinematographer Ritin Kumar, director and head storyteller, Cinelove Productions. Another wedding photographer, Amrit Arora, founder, The Wedding Files, shares, “I do have 6-7 weddings in Delhi for April. As of now, none of our clients called it off but one of them called to inform that they are planning to shift it to day wedding now. There were 2-3 queries which were going on and we were expecting them to get close but now they put it on hold.”For planners, the months put into planning and organising a wedding have gone down the drain. Aanchal Bagaria, co-founder, The Wedding Soul who had weddings scheduled in April with three-day affairs, says, “Now it’s all wrapped up to one single wedding to an afternoon lunch. Either couples are all together pushing dates to November, or opting for a sundowner wedding from 4-7pm. All our efforts and months of planning have gone in vain but have to face the fact.” She also states even for the month of May, weddings are uncertain as venues are not taking up bookings for large numbers. Wedding planners, Kaveri Vij and Akshay Chopra of Designer Events Inc. feels it is a recap of the last year as Vij says, “Just when we thought things have started to normalise, this comes a shocker. We are still hoping and keeping our fingers crossed that we do survive this. Few days before any wedding are the most hectic for us and we literally burn midnight oil to complete all the tasks at hand.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " \" 'Don't see him in CSK first-XI': Ojha on star India batsman  There was a round of applause in the auction table for Cheteshwar Pujara after Chennai Super Kings picked him up at his base price of ₹50 lakh earlier this year. India’s Test No.3 had found an IPL team after seven long years. The last time Pujara played the IPL was in 2014 and since then the right-hander has been going unsold in every auction barring this one.Pujara’s wait to return to the IPL will come to an end on April 9 when the 14th edition of the Indian Premier League begins. CSK, however will play their first match on April 10 against last year’s runner-up Delhi Capitals.Former India spinner Pragyan Ojha, however, believes Pujara will have to wait longer as he doesn’t see the right-hander making it to the CSK XI in the first phase of IPL 2021.Also Read | 'Seems to be a mid-table team': Aakash Chopra predicts RR's future in IPL 2021“I don't see Pujara in the CSK first-XI, he will be part of the dressing room but I don’t see him in the first XI. Maybe he can be a replacement for somebody later on in the tournament but he won’t start,” Ojha told Sports Today.Pujara has so far played only 30 matches in the IPL scoring only 390 runs at an average of 20.52. His strike rate of 99.74 is however the biggest worry.Ojha believes Pujara, despite being one of the top Test batsmen going around, Pujara will find it difficult in the IPL as the challenges of T20 cricket are different.“Pujara is a brilliant batsman, any format you talk about he has the skill and the temperament to play. He can perform, he's got the ability. But when we talk about T20 cricket, it is far away from Tests. You have to be very fit; the challenges are different on the field. That will be a challenge for Pujara.The former spinner who has shared the dressing room with Pujara while playing for India, did not forget to add that Pujara’s return to IPL is an inspirational tale for all youngsters.“I'm very happy for him. He's got his chance after 7 years so this itself is an inspirational tale for all the youngsters that you never lose hope, things will change around,” Ojha said.

I have forgotten what parties are like  Saqib Saleem loves birthdays and often throws big parties on the day. “But this will be my second birthday in a row, that has been spoiled due to Covid-19,” says the actor, who admits he is little heartbroken that he won’t be able to meet friends and enjoy the day as he used to. “In fact, I have forgotten what parties are like.

There is hunger to do more and keep trying my best. Acting is such a profession that no one can say I know everything. I became an actor without knowing anything about acting. I had never done theatre or acting workshops. My learning started after I faced the camera. I think I have gone from strength to strength whether it is my acting ability or my abilities as a person,” says the actor who will be shooting for the second season of his web show Crackdown.

The chief minister also announced extension of night curfew from 9pm to 5am, which hitherto was imposed in 12 districts, to the entire state and reduced the number of attendees at funeral/cremations/weddings to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors. Wearing masks has been made mandatory for all government employees while in office. Also read: What is driving India’s second Covid-19 wave?Schools stay closed, but relief for shop owners in malls These restrictions, coupled with the ones imposed earlier, which include the closure of schools and educational institutions, shall remain effective till April 30. However, there was some respite for shop owners in malls, as the entry of 10 people in a shop at any given time has been allowed, as against the earlier order of not allowing more than 100 people in a mall at one time. This would imply that 200 people will be allowed in a mall with 20 shops at any given time. In his weekly review of the Covid situation, the chief minister expressed concern at the high positivity and mortality rates in the state. He said it was matter of concern that over 85% of cases in Punjab are of the UK strain, which is more contagious and virulent. He said he had no option but to go in for stricter measures to further control the surge, even though the number of positive cases had somewhat stabilised in the last few days due to curbs imposed earlier. He said he had been forced to order a ban on political gatherings, as his pleas to all parties to refrain from organising such events had been ignored, despite the fact that the Congress had unilaterally announced its decision of not holding any rallies or public meetings last month. Amarinder guns for rallies by Kejriwal, Sukhbir Expressing surprise at the behaviour of certain political leaders, including Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who had been attending political rallies without following safety protocols, the chief minister said such irresponsible conduct doesn’t behove them. “How do you expect people to be serious about the spread of the disease if senior political leaders behave like this?” he said, adding that his government would need to be tough to tackle such violations and political leaders would also need to be booked. He ordered the police and the district administrations to register cases against political leaders, organisers and participants of such gatherings under the DMA and Epidemics Act, besides booking the owners of the tent houses, who provide the infrastructure for such gatherings. He said even the venue owners, who would provide space for such events, will not be spared and they would be booked, and their venues sealed for three months. No social, cultural or sports gatherings allowed He said that no social, cultural or sports gatherings and related functions will be allowed till April 30. In-person public dealing shall be restricted in all government offices and online and virtual modes for grievance redressal shall be encouraged.

              " ' Bengaluru citizens lend a pot to keep strays cool in summer  The searing heat has started to take a toll on people, but more so on animals and birds who have no recourse in summer. A group of kind-hearted volunteers have therefore taken it upon themselves to ensure that no animal in the city goes thirsty, and are distributing water bowls to residents, as part a group, Water for Voiceless. Conceived six years ago by Sunny Jain, a resident of Tumkur, this collective and has so far distributed more than 23,000 bowls across the country, with Bengaluru being the key focus area. Since the start of this year, they have already distributed 4,000 pots around the city, for free, in order to inspire people to take care of the needs of the voiceless. Jain says, “We aimed to make sure that clean water is available for drinking to all the animals around us, be it domestic or wild. This, we realised, was possible by creating a network of volunteers and more awareness among the masses.” The cemented pots are in two sizes; the smaller ones for birds can be kept on the terrace or balcony. In Bengaluru, a 25 member strong team distributes cemented pots in two sizes — small size pots for birds that are suitable to place on the terrace and balcony and large size pots for stray dogs and cows, which can be placed near the entry gate of houses. Praful Maun, one of the volunteers with this group, explains how the collective operates: “We have four modes of distribution. First, we have a collection point from where people can pick up the pots. Second, many of our volunteers conduct door to door distribution of the water pots. We then do community drives in multiple areas. And lastly, we partake in institutional or corporate drives. Our volunteers conduct camps in schools, colleges, and even police stations to create awareness on the importance of water and water pots.” The group is presently catering to around 25 centres in Bengaluru, including Vijaynagar, Cottonpet, Hosur, Domlur, HAL Basavanagar, Ulsoor, HSR Layout and HBR Layout; each centre has volunteers investing their time and effort for the noble cause. The latest feat has been the distribution of 225 water pots at St Joseph’s College in the city. “Our mission is to make water conservation, distribution of water for strays and planting of trees a part of school curriculum,” adds Jain. The group is at present organising distribution drives of water pots in around 25 centres at Bengaluru. Tina P Fernandes, a Bengaluru resident who has been distributing these water pots in the city, feels elated at the response of Bangaloreans, and says, “I initially joined the group because I thought I’ll take a few pots for my area, but later I started encouraging my family and friends to keep water for the voiceless. We now have a volunteers’ group where we coordinate for the distribution of pots... Even during the lockdown last year, I distributed close to 50 water pots in a day, from Koramangala to Bannerghatta road. People came till the main road junctions to collect these pots so that they could at least ensure clean water for the stray animals and birds.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The government had also made clear that the implementation of the 6th pay commission for transport workers was not possible, but has agreed for an 8 per cent increase in salary as an interim relief. Responding to a question on complaints regarding private services including buses, autos and cabs charging exorbitantly, the CM said strict instructions have been given in this regard and on receiving any complaint action will be taken. \"I appeal to them (private operators) not to charge exorbitantly taking advantage of the situation.. we will not allow it,\" he said. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who holds the Transport portfolio too said despite the government stating that it was ready for pay hike after permission from the election commission, some people have intentionally pushed for strike. \"I wont say those behind it are from political parties or others, it will be known in the days to come..\" he said without revealing much. The DCM said some buses are operating and their numbers will increase in all the four corporations in two days. \"Private buses are being provided facilities at our bus terminals to operate from. They have been allowed to operate without permit, but with insurance for the convenience of the passengers. In two days we will increase their numbers and from tomorrow about 4,000 private buses, those who have surrendered permits, will operate\" he added. Appealing to employees to get back to work, Savadi said income has completely stopped. \"It will be difficult to pay salary in the days to come, as long as you continue the strike it will harm you..\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics rtc strike bs yediyurappa karnataka + 1 more ',\n",

              " ' Rahul Gandhi bats for Covid vaccine for all; slams Centre’s ‘need vs want’ logic  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said Covid-19 vaccination should be open to people of all age groups, a day after the government ruled this out.The former Congress president and Wayanad MP tweeted, “ It’s ridiculous to debate needs and wants. Every Indian deserves the chance to a safe life.” He had earlier urged people to wear masks and follow all safety precautions.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said on Tuesday, “The aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it, but to those who need it”.Gandhi is the latest to join the vaccination-for-all cause and demand that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government should open Covid-19 vaccination to all age groups. On Tuesday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow all citizens above the age of 18 to get vaccinated. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also made similar requests.“It is high time that the government of India accepts what every public health expert within the country and globally has been saying— the second wave of Covid-19 is here. If having cases in excess of what we saw during the peak of the first wave in September 2020 is not a testimony to this, we wonder what else it would take for the government to accept this fact and re-strategise accordingly. The height (spike) of the Covid-19 cases is alarming, and the width (duration of the spike) of the Covid-19 cases needs to be curtailed now before this wave turns into a tsunami,’’ said Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera.The demand for opening vaccinations to everyone is becoming stronger as Covid-19 cases rise exponentially across India . India started the vaccination drive on January 16. The drive is currently in its third phase—everyone who is older than 45 is eligible to get vaccinated. Three months after it started the vaccination drive, India hit a grim milestone on Wednesday when it recorded 115,736 active Covid-19 cases, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic.India’s overall count has crossed the 12.8 million mark. Cases are rapidly increasing in Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka among others states. India’s daily Covid-19 tally is now the highest in the world, surpassing Brazil and the US, as it recorded over 100,000 cases in the last 24 hours. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Joji movie review: Top-rate crime thriller headlined by a terrific Fahadh Faasil  JojiDirector: Dileesh PothanCast: Fahadh Faasil, Baburaj, Shammi Thilakan and Sunny PNJoji, which is the third direct-OTT release for Fahadh Faasil in a span of six months, marks the third time collaboration for the star with director Dileesh Pothan and writer Syam Pushkaran. With each outing, the combo has only got stronger and managed to deliver work that will stand the test of time.In Joji, a top-rate crime thriller that examines the fall of a family, Dileep and Pushkaran join hands to explore the concept of greed and how it pushes someone to the edge until he loses it. Based on William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the film follows the events in the Kuttappan family after an unfortunate incident. Fahadh plays Joji, the youngest son of the Kuttappan family and he has big aspirations. However, his father feels he’s nothing but a loser. The two other sons are also controlled by their father and it’s a family powered by domineering patriarchy. But when the father suffers a stroke and is half-paralyzed, each member of the family has his/her own reason to celebrate. At the same time, the sons also feel that they will lose everything if their father recovers and survives. Joji comes up with a plan and pulls off the perfect crime but what follows snowballs into something messier.The film, aided by Syam Pushkaran’s solid writing, beautifully explores the dynamics of a family torn apart by greed and power. Even though based on Macbeth, the story feels highly relatable, and the characters are hard to judge. Joji works effectively as a slow-burning psychological drama as much as it’s about a crime and the events that follow. It’s more of a psychological drama because you’re left to wonder what’s cooking in Joji’s mind after he commits the first crime.The slow buildup to the crime is strongly complemented by the haunting score of Justin Varghese and the breathtaking visuals of Shyju Khalid. After committing the first crime, Joji wakes up the next morning and goes for a run and he reaches the top of a nearby mountain. When he stands at the tip of the mountain and looks down upon his house nearby, the visual is both beautiful and chilling.Also read: Anushka Sharma attempts to lift Virat Kohli in new video, watch her happy reaction on pulling it offIn what’s easily one of his juiciest performances in recent times, Fahadh breathes life into Joji – a sly, sadistic character with absolutely no remorse. It’s amazing how each of his collaborations with Dileesh and Syam has only resulted in a performance that’s hard to forget. As Joji, Fahadh is unbelievably good, bringing in a very sinister presence with his performance.The supporting cast is equally good, especially Unnimaya Prasad as Bincy, the daughter-in-law of the house. Her character is a modern-day version of lady Macbeth, and she’s equally terrifying with a calm presence.

              " \" Workers clear last train from deadly crash site in Taiwan  Cabin exposed, with half of its walls and roof gone, workers pulled out the last remaining train car in Taiwan's worst rail accident in seven decades.The crash site on the island's east coast was cleared, barring one car that was moved to the side of the tunnel where the train hit a construction truck that had fallen onto the track. Fifty people died and over 200 were injured in the crash on Friday.The driver of the truck, Lee Yi-hsiang, who is also the manager of the construction site above the tracks, has been detained on charges of causing death by negligence. He has apologised for the accident and promised to cooperate with investigators.While an initial report from transport safety officials said the brakes on the truck were not engaged, prosecutors declined to say what caused the vehicle to fall down the slope.Taiwan's Minister for Transportation and Communications Lin Chia-lung said Wednesday that he had offered his formal resignation to the island's president and premier.“I want to again express my deepest apologies to all the victims and their family and I will also take the political responsibility after completing all the relief work,” he said at a hearing by members of the transportation committee of the Legislative Assembly. “I will face it fully and meet it bravely.”The meeting started off with a moment of silence for the victims but quickly turned acrimonious when a group of opposition Nationalist Party politicians held up signs calling for the resignation of the minister and Premier Su Tseng-chang, shouting, “The government is a killer and must step down.”Members of the committee took turns to raise questions about the crash and rescue. One lawmaker asked Lin why certain safety improvements had not been completed since the last major train crash in 2018, which killed at least 18 people. Among those was an automatic system that would check on the condition of slopes by the railway tracks.They also raised concern over the slow reform of the indebted Taiwan Railways.

Stock recovered to trade up 17.6% after dropping as much as 3.6% in early session.\"The IPO did not have major demand during subscription in March as the company has been incurring losses in last three fiscal years, and overall, this isn\\'t a good time for the whole restaurant sector due to a rise in coronavirus cases,\" Saurabh Joshi, an equity research analyst at Marwari Shares and Finance Ltd said.\"The recovery in shares was purely because the overall market was positive,\" he added.Also Read | Barbeque Nation Hospitality IPO to be listed today.

              " ' Protests in Jammu seeking release of CRPF commando in Maoists captivity  Hundreds of residents including family members of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas, who is in Maoists’ captivity in Chhattisgarh, blocked a road in Jammu demanding his release. 35-year old Manhas, who hails from Jammu, was among the security personnel that were ambushed by the Maoists during a combing operation on Saturday, leaving 22 personnel dead and 31 others injured. “It’s been four days since my husband was abducted by the Maoists, but the government was doing nothing to ensure his release from captivity,” said Meenu, wife of Manhas, a member of the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action, popularly known as the CoBRA force of the CRPF, specialising in counter-insurgency operations.A press note issued on Tuesday by the Maoists’ Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee confirmed one jawan was in their custody and said he will be handed over to an interlocutor, whose appointment they sought immediately. Members of Manhas’ CoBRA unit, District Reserve Guard (DRG), and the Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives in the five-hour-long clash with Maoists at the Sukma-Bijapur border, with reports suggesting that around 20 insurgents were also killed. The Maoists, however, claimed that only four of their cadres were killed.“I don’t want anything. I just want my son back. Where is the government? Does the life of a Jawan has no value for this government?”, asked Manhas’ mother, who was among the protestors seeking his release.His father in law said, “For this day did we vote for this government? None has come to our rescue. He is our son in law and we want him back. How insensitive can the government be? It’s been four days since he was abducted by the Naxals on Saturday, but no one in the administration has bothered to reach out to us with an assurance”. Manhas joined the CRPF in March 2011 and got married in 2014. He has a five-year-old daughter and is the sole bread earner for his family. He was transferred to Chhattisgarh three months back from Assam. Manhas’ family first learnt about his abduction from a Chhattisgarh journalist, who called them to say that the Maoists told him that they had captured Manhas. The ultras, led by one of their top commanders, Mandvi Hidma, are said to have lured the security forces into a U shaped trap in the jungles near the Sukma-Bijapur border. The insurgents decamped with weapons, bullet-proof jackets, and even the shoes of dead soldiers after the ambush. Initial reports had then confirmed that one jawan was reported missing. Another relative said Manhas should be freed on priority as was done with the case of IAF wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was released five days following his capture in Pakistan after his MiG-21 Bison was shot down after successfully intercepting a posse of Pakistani fighters over the Line of Control in the Rajouri-Mendhar sector on 27 February 2019, the day after the Balakot strike. Before the IAF pilot ejected from his ageing MiG-21 hit in the aerial dogfight over the skies of Jammu, he shot down a fourth-generation F-16 fighter. He was captured by villagers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir where he landed and handed over to the Pakistan military. India had warned Pakistan of severe consequences if the fighter pilot was not released unharmed and immediately. Abhinandan was returned on March 1 via the heavily-guarded Wagah-Attari border post.“His mother sent him to serve the nation. We are poor people, we don’t have to do anything with politics but if the government could bring back wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan, then why have they been dragging their feet in getting our boy released from the captivity of Maoists,” he asked. The protestors in Jammu held tricolours and staged a sit-in at the main town chowk while shouting slogans against the BJP-led Central government and also against Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor (L-G) Manoj Sinha. No one from the administration was present there to meet the protesters till the filing of this report. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' A third of Covid-19 survivors suffer neurological, mental disorders: Study  One in three Covid-19 survivors in a study of more than 230,000 mostly American patients were diagnosed with a brain or psychiatric disorder within six months, suggesting the pandemic could lead to a wave of mental and neurological problems, scientists said on Tuesday.Researchers who conducted the analysis said it was not clear how the virus was linked to psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression, but that these were the most common diagnoses among the 14 disorders they looked at.Post-Covid cases of stroke, dementia and other neurological disorders were rarer, the researchers said, but were still significant, especially in those who had severe Covid-19.\"Although the individual risks for most disorders are small, the effect across the whole population may be substantial,\" said Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at Oxford University who co-led the work.Max Taquet, also an Oxford psychiatrist who worked with Harrison, noted that the study was not able to examine the biological or psychological mechanisms involved, but said urgent research is needed to identify these \"with a view to preventing or treating them\".Health experts are increasingly concerned by evidence of higher risks of brain and mental health disorders among Covid-19 survivors. A previous study by the same researchers found last year that 20% of COVID-19 survivors were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within three months.The new findings, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, analysed health records of 236,379 Covid-19 patients, mostly from the United States, and found 34% had been diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric illnesses within six months.The disorders were significantly more common in Covid-19 patients than in comparison groups of people who recovered from flu or other respiratory infections over the same time period, the scientists said, suggesting Covid-19 had a specific impact.Anxiety, at 17%, and mood disorders, at 14%, were the most common, and did not appear to be related to how mild or severe the patient\\'s Covid-19 infection had been.Among those who had been admitted to intensive care with severe Covid-19 however, 7% had a stroke within six months, and almost 2% were diagnosed with dementia.Independent experts said the findings were worrying.\"This is a very important paper. It confirms beyond any reasonable doubt that Covid-19 affects both brain and mind in equal measure,\" said Simon Wessely, chair of psychiatry at King\\'s College London.\"The impact Covid-19 is having on individuals\\' mental health can be severe,\" said Lea Milligan, chief executive of the MQ Mental Health research charity. \"This is contributing to the already rising levels of mental illness and requires further, urgent research.\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics covid-19 ',\n",

Bloomberg earlier reported the news.A distinguished scientist at Google, Bengio spent about 14 years at the company and was among its first employees involved in a decade-old project known as Google Brain that advanced algorithms crucial to the functioning of various modern AI systems.Andrew Ng, an early Brain member who now runs software startup Landing AI, said Bengio \"has been instrumental to moving forward AI technology and ethics.\" Another founding member, Jeff Dean, now oversees Google\\'s thousands of researchers.Google Brain researcher Sara Hooker in a tweet described Bengio\\'s departure as \"a huge loss for Google.\"In the internal email Bengio had sent, he said he decided to leave Google to pursue \"other exciting opportunities\" and that his last day would be April 28.Google fired staff scientist Margaret Mitchell in February after alleging she transferred electronic files out of the company. It fired fellow researcher Gebru in December after she threatened to quit rather than retract a paper.Mitchell has said she tried \"to raise concerns about race and gender inequity, and speak up about Google\\'s problematic firing of Dr. Gebru.\" Gebru has said the company wanted to suppress her criticism of its products and its efforts to increase workforce diversity. Google has said it accepted her offer to resign.Bengio had defended the pair, who co-led a team of about a dozen people researching ethical issues related to AI software. In December, Bengio wrote on Facebook that he was stunned that Gebru, whom he was managing, was removed from the company without him being consulted.Though he did not mention the firings in his farewell note, they influenced his decision to resign, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Bengio wrote in the email, \"I learned so much with all of you, in terms of machine learning research of course, but also on how difficult yet important it is to organize a large team of researchers so as to promote long term ambitious research, exploration, rigor, diversity and inclusion.\"Nicolas Le Roux, a Google Brain researcher, told Reuters that Bengio had devoted himself to making the research organization more inclusive and \"created a space where everyone felt welcome.\"Google recently moved oversight of the AI ethics team from Bengio to vice president Marian Croak. In February, Croak told staff at a town hall that Google wanted management that could focus fully on that area, saying it had just been a small part of what Bengio was supporting.Google also pledged several changes at the town hall aiming to regain researchers\\' trust, Reuters previously reported.

              " ' Recipe: Say ‘goodbye’ to stress with these chocolate covered frozen raspberries  A year in Covid-19 pandemic and we are unapologetically the lockdown chefs who couldn’t even whip up eggs for breakfast but now are pro from baking loafs of banana bread at home, Dalgona coffee as starters to even main course dishes. While we are still polishing our kitchen skills as the trending hobby, our passion for desserts has only grown stronger in the coronavirus lockdown courtesy hours of idling at home that became our base for work and play this past year.While our dessert cravings and kitchen skills are still in the pink of health, we decided to whip up some chocolate covered frozen raspberries to paint our mid-week blues, ruby red and chocolatey brown this Wednesday. Apart from lifting up our mood in a jiffy, chocolates’ reputation is rising for having antioxidant effects and reducing risk factors for heart disease courtesy its cocoa content.Check out the recipe of chocolate covered frozen raspberries here and join us in bringing a smile to snack table:Ingredients:28 fresh raspberries1/3 cup vanilla yogurt1/2 cup chocolate chips2 teaspoons coconut oilMethod:Rinse fresh raspberries and pat them dry with a paper towel. If needed, let them sit out to dry a bit because you don’t want them to be wet when you’re coating them with the yogurt. Cover a small baking sheet or flat baking dish with parchment paper.Using your fingers or a toothpick, dip each raspberry into the yogurt to coat. Place each yogurt covered raspberry onto the parchment. Once all the raspberries are coated, place in the freezer for 30-60 minutes to let the yogurt harden.Once the yogurt has hardened up, melt chocolate chips with coconut oil in the microwave on 30 second intervals, until melted and thin enough to dip or drizzle. Dip each yogurt covered raspberry into the melted chocolate and place back on the parchment lined sheet.Continue with remaining berries until they’re all coated. Place back in the freezer until chocolate has set and enjoy. Berries will last at 2-3 weeks in the freezer. They’re best if you take them out of the freezer and let them sit for 3-5 minutes before enjoying, otherwise they’re a bit too hard.(Recipe: Instagram/cleaneatgram)Benefits:Apart from being a very good source of fiber and high in antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress, raspberries are low in calories but boast many nutrients. Their consumption helps reduce the risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses due to their antioxidant content.They may positively impact blood sugar, improve arthritis, aid in weight loss and may also combat ageing.

The court of district and session judge Manoj Kumar Singh also imposed a fine of ₹1.5 lakh on each convict on Tuesday.The case dates back to September 21, 2016, when a Railway Protection Force (RPF) team nabbed the four women -- Ruby Devi alias Shakuntala, a resident of Raxaul; Sangita Devi alias Bagad, a resident of Turkaulia; Pinki Devi alias Sunaina and Rita Devi alias Baby, both from Banjaria, from a general compartment of Satyagrah Express at Narkatiaganj railway station.According to the special public prosecutor, Suresh Kumar, the RPF team got intelligence input from the 44th battalion of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) that four women were travelling in the train with banned drugs. The suspects were bringing narcotics from Nepal hidden in six bags. The RPF team, with the help of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), seized over 31kg of opioid from their possession.All the four women were arrested after they could not produce any licence or permit for carrying the contraband and a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered against them.The 1,751-km border with Nepal is notorious for smuggling drugs, weapons and fertilizers, besides human trafficking, data showed. In February this year, three Nepali citizens were arrested with 265 kilograms of charas, hidden in a compartment made in a pickup van, in Gopalganj.

The government has also banned political gatherings till the restricted period and said violators, including political leaders, will be booked under Disaster Management Act(DMA) and Epidemics Act. Punjab is one of the states of concern as said by the Union health ministry due to its major contribution to the active cases and fatalities of the country.Chief minister Amarinder Singh did not miss the opportunity to chide leaders like Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, SAD’s Sukhbir Singh Badal, and expressed surprise at their behaviour for attending political rallies without adhering to Covid safety protocol, at a time when the virus is spreading so fast in the country.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi bats for Covid vaccine for all; slams Centre’s ‘need vs want’ logic“How do you expect people to be serious about the spread of the disease if senior political leaders behave like this,” Singh said, adding that the government would need to be tough to tackle such violations and book the political leaders as well, in case of any violations.Ordering the police and district administrations to register cases against the leaders, organisers, and participants of the gatherings under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemics Act, he said even the venue owners, who would provide space for such events, will not be spared. They too would be booked, and their venues will be sealed for three months.The state government also put a cap on the number of attendees at funerals, cremations, and weddings to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors. Wearing masks is now mandatory for all government employees while in the office. The new restrictions, with the curbs already in place like the closure of schools and educational institutions, except medical and nursing colleges, will remain effective till April 30.The chief minister during his weekly review of the Covid-19 situation said it is a matter of concern that over 85 per cent of the cases in the state are of the UK strain, which he said is more contagious and virulent.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Other curbs imposed in the state include a ban on social, cultural, or sports gatherings and related functions, in-person public dealing to be restricted in all government offices, and virtual modes of grievance redressal encouraged. Citizens should be encouraged to visit public offices only for essential services and the concerned departments should issue instructions for limiting daily appointments for works like registries etc, Singh said, adding that cinema halls will operate at their 50 per cent capacity.However, there is some respite for shop owners in malls as the chief minister allowed entry of ten people per shop at any time, as against the previous order of not allowing more than 100 people in a mall at one time.Singh directed Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict compliance to the night curfew.

The big-hitting Australian all-rounder, who endured a forgettable season last year, scoring just around 108 runs from 13 matches for Punjab Kings, has found a new home, and in the presence of mega stars Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers is expected to play the big role in RCB\\'s campaign in IPL 2021.Daniel Vettori, who in the past has been involved with RCB believes that with most of the focus being on Kohli and de Villiers can actually work in Maxwell\\'s favour, allowing him to finally have a season expected of him.Also Read | \\'Very disappointing, hasn\\'t succeeded in IPL\\': Gambhir on RCB\\'s ₹14.25 Cr buy\"The emphasis normally is on AB and Kohli, and Maxwell in a way can fly under the radar. Hopefully that lack of pressure will allow him to have an IPL that everyone expects him to most years,\" Vettori told ESPNCricinfo.Maxwell, who has a huge reputation in the IPL, last fired in real terms back in 2017, scoring 310 runs from 14 matches. In 2018, he scored 169 runs from 12 matches before skipping IPL 2019 to keep himself fresh ahead of the World Cup. 2020 was Maxwell\\'s worst season in terms of numbers, with the batsman failing to hit even a single six in the tournament.Also Read | \\'He said I will get better with experience\\': Natarajan recalls Dhoni\\'s adviceGetting the best out of Maxwell can be challenging but Vettori feels the batsman can flourish if shared leadership role.

He\\'s been given a lot of responsibility and I think that\\'s where teams tend to get the best out of him.

              " ' Florida evacuations order lifted as danger from leaky wastewater reservoir fades  Evacuation orders were lifted on Tuesday for hundreds of residents near Tampa Bay in Florida as crews relieved pressure on the containment wall surrounding a leaky wastewater reservoir, reducing the threat of a toxic flash flood.Residents and local businesses were permitted to return after data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers showed a diminished risk of a catastrophic collapse at the site of the former Piney Point phosphate plant.The Army Corps and local public safety crews have worked around the clock for days pumping hundreds of millions of gallons of water out of the reservoir to ease pressure on its weakened containment wall.The crisis began last Thursday when officials discovered leaks in the structure, lined with tall stacks of phosphogypsum waste, an industrial byproduct from fertilizer manufacturing known to emit radon, a cancer-causing radioactive gas.State environmental officials have said tests of water seeping from the reservoir showed it was not radioactive.But local authorities nevertheless said they feared that an all-out, uncontrolled breach of the wall could unleash a 20-foot torrent of untreated wastewater into the surrounding area, and they ordered a mandatory evacuation of more than 300 nearby homes as a precaution over the weekend. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a local state of emergency on Saturday.\"We\\'re now ending our fifth day since learning of a breach at the site, and I am in awe over the state, federal and local cooperation to ensure the safety of our residents,\" Manatee County Commission Chairman Vanessa Baugh said in a statement announcing the lifting of the evacuation.While the pumping operation eased the threat to homes and businesses adjacent to the reservoir, the wastewater drainage was being routed into a nearby Gulf Coast seaport, posing environmental concerns there.Ed Sherwood, executive director of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, said pumping the nutrient-dense discharge into Port Manatee at the mouth of Tampa Bay could spawn algal blooms toxic to marine life in the estuary.(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics florida ',\n",
              " ' What is driving India’s second Covid-19 wave?  We have seen miracles, and we have seen disasters. In September 2020, India came close to 100,000 Covid-19 cases a day, and it seemed an inexorable rise. And then magically, the cases started to dip, and with a few blips here and there in specific cities, by January, we were seeing fewer than 10,000 new cases a day. In February, the numbers starting heading up again, and we have now breached 100,000 new cases per day, the second country in the world to do so.Why did this happen now? Why did the numbers escalate beyond what India had at its peak the first time? For the Sars-CoV-2, it does not take a lot of virus to infect another person. When people mingle, speak, shout and sing, they unknowingly spew out infectious virus. This clear mode of transmission is what makes masks, distancing and ventilation so effective. In September, we cared about prevention, and emerging from severe restrictions, were willing to do what it took to keep spread down. From then on, week by week, we have been slipping, first in some regions, then others, with some activities and then others. Crowding on public transport, in markets, at festivals, at family celebrations and during elections are back to being acceptable. The communication from the government and of experts seem to go unheard.Also Read | India surpasses US to become fastest Covid-19 vaccinating country, says CentreAlso Watch | How India could have avoided second Covid wave & why next 45 days is crucial This lack of appropriate behaviour that could prevent the virus’ spread has increased, and potentially been amplified, because of viruses that are more transmissible than the ancestral version of the virus that we had last year. We are still not clear about the proportion of B.1.1.7 or the United Kingdom variant, which spreads more easily and may cause more severe disease, and which has badly affected Punjab, and possibly other states.The new Indian so-called “double mutant” variant is now the global lineage B1.617. But is this virus more transmissible? Does it cause more severe disease? Will vaccines work? These are questions that we will be able to answer if we can interrogate our health data and back it up with standardised laboratory investigations as in other parts of the world.We have two vaccines that work well against Sars-CoV-2. Covishield had the advantage of large-scale clinical trials being conducted elsewhere that generated efficacy data quickly, requiring small scale studies in India. But it also has a disadvantage — the initial messy data about doses, intervals and age groups and miscommunication by AstraZeneca have led to confused messaging about how to use the vaccine. Covaxin has the advantage of tremendous support from the government of India but the disadvantage of needing to do large-scale clinical trials in India, never an easy task, given the lack of clinical research experience at many sites.But the roll-out of vaccines, despite the fast-tracking of approvals, prioritisation frameworks, central procurement, efforts at preparedness for vaccination sites and sessions, establishment of process and development of the CoWin app, has been slow. The government originally planned to immunise 300 million people by June-July (later July-August), and this appears very unlikely if the pace of vaccination does not increase several-fold.Are we in the same position that we were in during the rapid increase of the first peak in India? If not, what makes it different? From the serological surveys, between a quarter and one-third of the population has been infected but this is not evenly distributed by place and stratum of society; so those who had the ability to isolate last year and are not yet vaccinated, are more likely to get infected. But given that vaccines work much better than expected, it is not unreasonable to suppose that our immune systems are capable of handling this virus well. This means that previously infected people should expect some protection against severe disease for several months.Additionally available vaccines provide some, not complete, measure of protection against most viral variants. If one-third of the population is already protected at least against severe disease, and we can ramp up vaccination quickly while continuing the measures that we know restrict the spread of the virus, then control is feasible, even with the new variants.We know what works, but to use the tools we have most effectively, we need more detailed data. We are not in the same situation today that we were in last year, so control measures cannot be one-size-fits-all.We need to know more about the people who are getting infected. Where are they from? Age? Gender? Vaccinated? Previously infected? Disease severity? If we have this information and can tie it together, we can achieve more tailored strategies for control instead of strategies that have an uncertain effect. What does a night curfew prevent and how effective is it? We don’t really have the data.Yet, on the other hand, we are bombarded by news that affects vaccine uptake, for instance, “Doctors infected after vaccination”, “Healthcare worker in XX dies two days after vaccination”. Conveying both truth and uncertainty is important, as is explaining with facts that vaccines are not perfect, that care continues to be required when there are high numbers of cases in our communities, that we have a surveillance system for picking up vaccine side-effects, but it may not be always able to assess the relationship with the vaccines.This is a challenging time, but we have the science to help us get through this pandemic and future ones. We need to use it, together.Gagandeep Kang is professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore The views expressed are personal SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' A timeline of Australia\\'s Covid-19 vaccine plan mired in European back-and-forth  Australia said on Wednesday the European Union asked it to withdraw export permit applications for exports of AstraZeneca\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, and its denial that it blocked shipments were simply \"semantics\".The dispute emphasises the challenge facing European nations to vaccinate their populations and the impact on any vaccine export restrictions on countries that had pre-ordered doses.Here\\'s a timeline of how the shipment of 3.1 million doses of AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine from Europe to Australia has stalled.SEPTEMBER 2020:Australia orders 3.8 million doses of Europe-manufactured COVID-19 vaccine being trialled by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc for early 2021 delivery that is to underpin the early stages of Australia\\'s inoculation programme, now running behind schedule.Australia bankrolls biopharma CSL Ltd to make another 30 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine domestically, later increased to 50 million.NOVEMBER 2020:Australia also orders 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.JANUARY 2021:European Union grants conditional approval for AstraZeneca vaccine.Australia grants Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine approval. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he plans to have 4 million of the country\\'s 25 million population vaccinated by the end of March.EU introduces export controls over vaccine, citing supply shortage.AstraZeneca says only 1.2 million offshore-manufactured vaccine doses can be delivered to Australia by end-March, due to export controls.FEBRUARY 2021:First Pfizer vaccines arrive in the country; first inoculations take place.Australian health authorities approve AstraZeneca vaccine.Australia receives first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Europe, with 300,000 doses.AstraZeneca applies to the EU for export licence to ship another 500,000 doses, which are being made in Italy, to Australia, according to Morrison.EU tells AstraZeneca to re-submit application for just 250,000 doses.

              " ' Moderna Covid-19 vaccine rolled out in UK for the 1st time  The U.K. will begin rolling out the Moderna Inc. vaccine on Wednesday, bolstering Britain’s Covid-19 immunization program amid concerns over AstraZeneca Plc’s shot and a shortfall of doses this month.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Moderna shot would first be offered in west Wales. It is the third approved vaccine to be offered in Britain, alongside shots from AstraZeneca and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, and its rollout is around two weeks earlier than expected.The UK has ordered 17 million doses of Moderna’s two-shot vaccine, enough for 8.5 million people.The success of the vaccine program is crucial to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ambition to fully reopen the U.K. economy on June 21. On Tuesday, he sought to reassure people over the Astra vaccine amid ongoing concerns in Europe over possible side effects.It later emerged that vaccinations of children in a study of the shot developed by Astra and Oxford University have been paused while the U.K.’s drug regulator investigates rare cases of blood clots in adults. No safety issues have arisen in the children’s trial, Oxford said.“The U.K. government has secured vaccines on behalf of the entire nation and the vaccination program has shown our country working together at its best,” Hancock said in an emailed statement. “Wherever you live, when you get the call, get the jab.”‘On Track’The government has insisted it is on track to meet its target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July, despite a reduction in doses this April and a potentially slower pace than expected in the months ahead. Vaccination centers and pharmacies are facing a “significant reduction” in supply during April, NHS England warned last month -- meaning that older people waiting for second doses will be prioritized over younger people getting their first shot. The pace of the rollout across England is now estimated by the Cabinet Office at an average of 2.7 million doses a week until the end of July -- “considerably slower” than a previous forecast of 3.2 million a week, according to a modeling paper from scientists on a government advisory committee published Monday.Johnson’s official spokesman Jamie Davies said the government “never talked about details around supplies and deliveries” of vaccines.“There will be a slight reduction in April but the key thing to remember is that that doesn’t mean that we’re not on track to meet our pledges,” Davies told reporters on Tuesday. The U.K. remains “on track” to offer a first dose to all over-50s by April 15, and to all adults by the end of July, he said.The rollout of the Moderna shot in the U.K. is earlier than expected. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Tuesday it would happen “around the third week of April”.Three in five adults in the U.K. have been vaccinated so far, Hancock said on Twitter. The most recent government data shows that more than 31.6 million people have received a first dose, and 5.5 million have had a second dose.Speaking on a visit to an Astra manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, northwest England, Johnson urged people to listen to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the U.K.’s drug watchdog.“Their advice to people is to keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab,” he said.

              " ' Will Indian pitches help fast bowlers in this IPL?  Among other unprecedented events, the previous edition of the IPL in late 2020 will be remembered for the show put on by the fast bowlers. With pace and carry on offer at two out of the three venues in the UAE, namely the Dubai International Cricket Stadium and the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, the very fast men hogged the limelight.The IPL record for the fastest ball was smashed (by a 156.2kph ball by Delhi Capitals’s Anrich Nortje), leaving many wondering if the fastest ever ball across cricket would be witnessed as well. It wasn’t, but everyone was left marvelling at the skills of these speedsters. They turned IPL 13 into a spectacle of fast bowling, with stumps flying off searing yorkers and batsmen constantly being tested with rising balls. All that became a common sight.Five of the top seven wicket-takers were fast bowlers. DC’s Kagiso Rabada topped the list, followed by Mumbai Indians’s lethal pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult. Such pairings were all around – Rabada and Nortje in Delhi, Lockie Ferguson and Pat Cummins bowling in tandem for Kolkata Knight Riders. Some teams had lone wolves, but Rajasthan Royals’s Jofra Archer and Kings XI Punjab’s Mohammed Shami enjoyed themselves just as much.But now, as the IPL returns home, it remains to be seen whether the fast men can light up a tournament on Indian wickets. It could well happen, but for that a good wicket remains key.In the UAE, all three grounds were neutral venues. The groundsmen’s focus, hence, was to roll out good surfaces without favouring any side. The scenario remains the same in the upcoming IPL. No team is based at home despite the league matches being staged in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata (the venue for the play-offs is Ahmedabad). So, as one senior curator put it, they won’t have to deal with any “khichar-pichar\" of the captains and coaches.“For the success of the IPL, good grounds and pitches are very important,” says Daljit Singh, former head of BCCI’s pitch and grounds committee, who had overseen the IPL grounds from the inaugural season all the way until his retirement in 2019.What regularly tends to happen with home teams is this: if the franchise wins a match on a particular wicket, they end up sticking to the same wicket for the next game, despite the compact schedule with back-to-back matches. But now, Daljit says that “curators will have a free hand to rotate the pitches and play on fresh wickets.”“If they take the services of the BCCI pitch curators, then we have taught them to keep grass on it,” says Daljit. “But it shouldn’t be green. That doesn’t suit T20s. The grass layer should be 4mm to 5mm, and it should be brown and dry. Then the ball comes rapidly on to the bat, which helps in stroke-making. Bottom-up rolling will give good bounce for a wicket, where you play cuts and pulls.”According to Daljit, Wankhede Stadium and Eden Gardens are the grounds where the fast bowlers can make a big impact in the upcoming season. “I think in Mumbai we will see good pitches. Kolkata too. Chennai will not have bouncy pitches from what we have seen but you can surely roll out batting pitches, where 180-plus scores can be made.”The Wankhede turf is known to provide good bounce. “Ball niklega mast (it will nip off the wicket nicely),” says a senior groundsman at Wankhede. “Every year due to wear and tear and a lot of rolling, the pitches used to be tired by the time IPL started. Though there have been local matches and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy games played here, pitches will be relatively fresh. We will keep grass this time, which after rolling will get yellow. The idea is to prepare a good wicket and have a good game.”Another reason why the fast bowlers were able to go flat out in the UAE was because there was no fear of top edges flying into the stands, as the boundaries were big enough in two of the three venues – Dubai and Abu Dhabi. On Indian grounds, clearing the ropes is far easier. Delhi and Chennai will, in all probability, roll out batting wickets. And the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore has short boundaries, where bowlers have always struggled to defend totals.However, the spinners and swing bowlers will not complain about the conditions in India. Reduced to playing a supporting role in the UAE, the slower ones will look to take back the centre stage. Take Chennai Super Kings’ Imran Tahir, for example. The leg-spinner was the highest wicket-taker in 2019 with 26 wickets. But in the last edition he got to play just three games and took only one wicket. The South African will now return as the leader of CSK’s attack once again.Tahir’s case is quite like Deepak Chahar’s, who relies on swinging the new ball. In the UAE where it was more about raw pace, he had a limited role to play, finishing with 12 wickets in 14 games. In the 2019 edition, he had 22 wickets, the third highest in the tournament. Also look out for the slower pacers who have complete mastery over their variations -- slower balls, good yorkers and plenty of pace changes – such as Dwayne Bravo, Sandeep Sharma and Siddarth Kaul.But Mike Hesson, head of cricket at Royal Challengers Bangalore, believes that adaptability will be the real key to success. In his pre-season presser, Hesson said: “We might want to change the style of play at a particular venue. There might be certain grounds where we might need bowlers to bowl more cutters, some venues where we might need them to bowl bouncers. At venues where the ball will turn, we need left-handers to bat in the middle. There are several different factors, and I am pleased with the balance of the squad. We have got a squad of 22, and each of them could step up and be counted in certain conditions.\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics ipl 2021 ',\n",
              " ' Study suggests risk of leukemia higher in children with Down syndrome  Down syndrome is one of the most common genetic conditions in the US and Canada. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born in the United States each year. That is approximately one in every 700 babies born in the US and one in 750 newborns in Canada.Children with Down syndrome have a substantially increased risk of multiple health conditions compared to the general population. They have a particularly elevated risk (estimated 150-fold) of developing AML before age of five.The study confirmed that Down syndrome is a strong risk factor for childhood leukemia.Study findings on leukemia in children with Down syndromeThe researchers examined medical data of more than 3.9 million children born 1996-2016 in seven US healthcare systems or in Ontario, Canada. The data included the children\\'s health information from birth to cancer diagnosis, death, age of 15 years, disenrollment, or December 30, 2016.\"One main strength of this study is its large cohort with more leukemia cases in children with Down syndrome than most previous studies,\" said Emily Marlow, first author and a recent graduate from UC Davis Department of Public Health Sciences and Graduate Group in Epidemiology.\"This allowed more precise risk estimation, especially for rare leukemia types such as AML-7, previously estimated from small case reports,\" added Marlow.The study estimated the incidence and hazard ratios of leukemia for children with Down syndrome and other children, adjusting for the health system, child\\'s age at diagnosis, birth year and sex. It found that 2.8 per cent of children with Down syndrome were diagnosed with leukemia, compared to 0.05 per cent of other children.Compared to other children, kids with Down syndrome had a higher risk of AML before the age of five and a higher risk of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) regardless of age. In children with Down syndrome, ALL was more common between ages two-four years, while AML was more common in younger kids - the highest incidence during the first year of life. For other children, AML incidence remained very low through age 14 years, whereas ALL peaked at the age of three years and steadily declined until the age of eight years.The study also found that males and Hispanic children were more likely to be diagnosed with Down syndrome and more likely to develop leukemia than their counterparts. White children have a higher incidence rate of ALL and more likely to have Down syndrome than Black children.Catching leukemia in kidsThe researchers urged parents with kids with Down syndrome to keep an eye for signs of leukemia. Common symptoms include fatigue or pale skin, infections and fever, easy bleeding or bruising, shortness of breath and coughing. Parents are advised to talk to the pediatrician if their children exhibit any of these symptoms.\"The good news is that childhood leukemia can be very treatable if caught early,\" said co-senior author Diana L. Miglioretti, professor and division chief of biostatistics at the UC Davis Department of Public Health Sciences and affiliate investigator with Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research.Imaging technologies and leukemiaA steep rise in medical imaging over the past two decades, particularly in computed tomography (CT) exams, increased children\\'s exposure to higher levels of radiation. Previous studies have shown that CT scanning increases leukemia risk.\"Given the potential for ionizing radiation to increase leukemia risk in children with Down syndrome, other non-ionizing radiation modes of imaging, such as ultrasound and MRI, should be used as the first line image tests,\" said co-senior author Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a UCSF School of Medicine professor with the Departments of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging and of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.

              " ' Chhattisgarh ambush: Maoists release image of missing commando  A photograph of a commando from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s elite CoBRA unit -- missing after a deadly April 2 ambush by Maoist ultras in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma-Bijapur region -- was released on Wednesday by Maoists, who have demanded that a mediator be appointed by the government to negotiate his release.This photograph, which was circulating on social media, surfaced on a day the soldier’s family protested in Jammu, demanding that the government facilitate his swift return.The photograph showed Rakeshwar Singh Manhas, 35, a commando with the 210th CoBRA battalion, sitting alone in what appeared to be a hut. According to local journalists in the region, the photo was sent on WhatsApp. “At 11.27am, a photograph of the missing jawan was sent on a WhatsApp number by Maoist leader Vikalp,” said Sukma-based journalist Raja Rathore.When asked about Manhas’s photograph, inspector general of police (Bastar range), Sundarraj P, said the situation was being closely monitored.“All best possible efforts are being made to secure the safe return of the jawan,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.On Tuesday evening, the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) issued a press release, signed by its spokesperson Vikalp, asking the government to decide on a mediator to discuss Manhas’s release. The note, issued by the Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee said: “The state government should appoint interlocutor, we will then handover the jawan to them. Until then, the jawan will be safe in the custody of Jantana Sarkar.”Though no interlocutor has been named, tribal activist Soni Sori left for the encounter site on Wednesday to appeal to Maoists to release the abducted jawan. “The government should have taken steps to secure the release of the jawan. I just want that the jawan be freed safely, for which I am going to the incident site,” Sori told reporters.Meanwhile, in Manhas’s home town in Jammu, hundreds of protesters, including the commando’s family, staged a sit-in at Barnai Chowk on Wednesday, and demanded that the government show the same urgency to facilitate his release that was shown in bringing back wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was taken hostage by Pakistan after the 2019 Balakot strike.Manhas’s wife, Meenu, who learnt of his abduction from a local reporter in Chhattisgarh on the day of the ambush, said: “It’s been four days since my husband was abducted by Maoists but the government is doing nothing to ensure his release from captivity... If a jawan is late to report to duty by just one day after leave, action is taken against him, but here, he is missing since Saturday and nobody is bothered.”She added that the family has not heard either from the government or the CRPF, and whatever information they had was through the media. Manhas is the family’s sole breadwinner, and has a five-year-old daughter.Twenty-two soldiers from the CRPF’s CoBRA unit, District Reserve Guard, and the Special Task Force lost their lives in a five-hour-long clash with Maoists. This was the deadliest Maoist attack in the region in the last four years, and prompted Union home minister Amit Shah to describe it as a “decisive turn” in the fight against Maoist ultras. Shah also said this week that the issue would reach its “logical end”.Officials said that several Maoists -- HT reported that officials estimated the number to be between 12 and 20 -- were also killed in the gunfight. The Maoists, however, claimed in a statement on Tuesday that only four of their cadre were killed.“The Maoists are showing definite interest for talks in each of their press notes after this sad incident. Possible negotiation to release the CRPF jawan can be a very good beginning in an otherwise very grim situation if followed through creatively,” Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a peace activist working in Bastar, said.

              " \" IPL 2021: Dynamic pacers, explosive finishers, DC have a team to go all the way  Delhi Capitals is perhaps the most improved side of IPL in the last few years. Ever since Shreyas Iyer took over the captaincy from Gautam Gambhir mid-way through IPL 2018, DC started improving in leaps and bounces. They made the play-offs in IPL 2019 and went all the way to the finals in 2020 only to be beaten by eventual champions Mumbai Indians. In IPL 2021, DC would be hoping to cross the final huddle.DC, however, were jolted even before the start of this year’s IPL. Their regular captain Shreyas Iyer was ruled out of the tournament with a shoulder injury. Despite having the likes of Steve Smith, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane who have either captained in international matches or IPL, DC decided to show faith in wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant as the skipper of the side.Also Read | Will Pant lead DC to their maiden IPL title? Kapil Dev gives fascinating answerHere is the SWOT analysis of DC ahead of IPL 2021StrengthsPacersDC has the most formidable pace attack this season. Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje can send chills down the spine of any batting line-up. Their weakness of a 3rd seamer from last season has also been covered in the form of Umesh Yadav and L Meriwala. Add Ishant Sharma to that list (Didn’t play last season due to injury) and the pace attack is unrivalled.Explosive finishersWith the likes of Rishabh Pant, Marcus Stoinis, Shimron Hetmyer & Axar Patel in the middle and lower middle-order, the finishing power of DC is one of the finest. While Stoinis can play anywhere and Pant’s current form make him among the most dangerous finishers in the game, Hetmyer can build the innings and go hammer and tongs towards the end.WeaknessWicket-keeping optionsBarring Pant there is no recognised Indian keeper in the side. While Vishnu Vinod is a viable option, but his finishing abilities are nowhere near Pant. New recruit Sam Billings is another option that is available but to bring in an overseas player, the entire composition of the team will have to be changed.Lack of quality all-roundersAxar Patel and Marcus Stoinis are the only 2 renowned IPL All-rounders DC have in their team. If any one of them were to get injured during the season they might have to depend on the likes of Lalit Yadav or Ripal Patel. Chris Woakes is another option they can turn too but he has been a no-show in the last couple of seasons.Also Read | IPL 2021 - Two of India's best, 3 lethal overseas quicks: Top 5 seamers to watchOpportunityOpening SpotDC is a squad who have no less than 4 openers in Dhawan, Shaw, Rahane, Smith. Stoinis as we know has done a great job opening the innings in the shortest form of the game. Looking at previous year’s performances, Dhawan will most probably keep his place but his partner’s place is up for grabs. Shaw will come into the side with a record-breaking Vijay Hazare trophy and will be eager to get his spot back. Smith has proven he can be as good as an opener in T20s.Billings/HetmyerBoth billings and Hetmyer fit the bill for the middle-order’s slot. While still untested in the IPL, Billings has shown glimpses of what he can do for England, Hetmyer too didn’t do his reputation any harm in the last season of IPL.ThreatsInjury ListIshant Sharma, Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Umesh Yadav are all prone to injury. If both Ishant and Umesh were to be injured, the 3rd pacer syndrome will catch up once again to DC. An injury to Amit Mishra and Ravi Ashwin will leave Axar Patel alone like last season. Though they have youngsters like Meriwala, Siddharth and Pravin Dubey to call upon but they sure won’t be as impactful as the senior pros. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi capitals ipl 2021 \",\n",
              " ' Thunderstorm in south Punjab leaves wheat growers worried  A strong thunderstorm swept across south Punjab on Tuesday night and led to the lodging of wheat crop ahead of next week’s harvest season besides damaging kinnow orchards where trees are in the early fruit bearing stage. Bathinda and adjoining districts also got mild rainfall after the high-velocity wind. It’s the second spell of rough weather in a fortnight when the semi-arid region has faced untimely rains and gusty winds. Also read: Punjab sets up 3,700 mandis for procuring wheat amid Covid surgeFarm experts say irrigated wheat fields, or the late sown varieties are likely to face maximum damage. According to Punjab Agricultural University’s observatory at the Bathinda-based regional research centre, south Malwa witnessed winds with a velocity of up to 92.6 kmph on Tuesday evening. The winds damaged vegetable and mustard crops in the final stage of harvest. Ripened wheat not prone to damage: Expert Mansa chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said ripened wheat plants lose weight and they are not prone to much damage despite strong winds. Preliminary inputs don’t suggest any major crop loss due to the storm, he said. “Major rabi crop of the region is in the last phase of maturity and no widespread damage is expected from the thunderstorm. Field staff has been deployed to assess the extent of the crop damage,” he said. May delay harvest but not expected to hit yield Farmer Budh Singh of Bibiwala village in Bathinda’s periphery said the storm caused lodging of up to 60% of his wheat field on Tuesday night. Gurjit Romana, a farmer from Danewala Satkosi village near Abohar in Fazilka district, said the dust storm lasted for 40 minutes. “Kinnow orchards were worst hit, while lodging of mustard plants occurred,” he said. Balwinder Tikka, a progressive farmer from Malout in Muktsar district, said waterlogging in the low-lying fields will delay the wheat harvest. “The crop has been flattened in several areas though eventually a bumper yield is expected,” he said, adding that the inclement weather at this stage is a concern.

Yellow notices are for those with 40% to 80% immunization rates, while red logos indicate fewer than 40% of people are protected.While no penalties or specific consequences have been announced for low vaccination rates, many buildings have organized on-site immunization drives to make it easier for workers to get their shots. The stepped up efforts are adding extra pressure to local officials and employers amid fears that lagging vaccination rates may put reopening the economy at risk.China has set a goal of vaccinating 40% of its total population, or some 560 million people, by end of June. Tens of millions of workers at state-owned enterprises, party members, and college students are required to get immunized unless they provide a medical reason, while the government is offering incentives including small gifts and free rides to vaccination appointments to encourage the shots.The office signs build on a system China introduced last year that requires people to show a green code, indicating they are at low risk of having been exposed to Covid-19, before being permitted to enter almost all public venues, including restaurants, shops, and hotels. The assessment comes from built-in smartphone apps designed by China’s two biggest Internet companies that pull personal data from phone carriers and government departments.China has given about 4.5 million doses of vaccine on average each day for the past week. That’s close to the 5 million a day needed to reach an additional 417 million people, the number that will allow it to meet its vaccine goal before July.While the pace is significantly faster than the 3 million doses per day given on average in the U.S., it’s a much smaller proportion of the population. Only five doses per 100 people have been given so far in China, trailing the 56 per 100 people in Israel and 26 per 100 in the U.S., Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker shows.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

              " ' Goa seeks permission to vaccinate all tourism sector workers irrespective of age  The Goa government has sought special permission from the Centre to vaccinate all workers in the state’s tourism sector, even if they are below 45 years of age, citing the sector’s criticality, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday.“Our attempt is that all those working in the tourism line -- all those above 45 should get vaccinated -- but we have written a letter seeking permission that those working in the tourism industry even if they are below 45 should be vaccinated,” Sawant said.Tourism sector is a big source of revenue for the state and also provides employment to nearly 35% of the state’s population that is dependent on the sector, according to official estimates. A total of 25-lakh tourists have visited Goa since travel restrictions were eased after lifting of the lockdown, imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic last year. Prior to the pandemic, the state witnessed close to eight million domestic tourists and more than nine hundred thousand foreign tourists.“For now, we don’t have permission, but if we get the permission, then we are ready to vaccinate all those working in the tourism industry,” Sawant added.Various sectors in the state, including manufacturing and services, have been seeking the expansion of the vaccination drive to cover those who come in contact with customers while working, said the CM.“Being a touristic state and given that the economy has only now begun to revive, we are only advising people to avoid and restrict gatherings,” Sawant said, when asked whether tourists arriving in the state should be made to produce Covid negative certificates upon arrival, a demand that is being made by civil society in the state.Sawant said the police have been told to crackdown on those not wearing masks in crowded places like markets, bus stands and other public places, even beaches.“Enforcement will be done in a big way. It’s not that Covid is coming from the tourists only. Covid is spreading internally in the state as well. Our people should also not mix up with tourists,” Sawant said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Most travellers postponing trips due to rise in Covid-19 cases: Portals  The second wave of Covid-19 seems to be impact travellers, albeit marginally. Travel portals are recording a minor drop in the number of travellers as some have opted to postpone their plans.MakeMyTrip said the second wave of Covid-19 is having a knock-on effect and they foresee a transitory slump in travel bookings in the near future.“While there is an understandable dip in leisure travel as uncertainty around the virus returns, a faster vaccine roll-out should also have a bearing on the overall sentiment in the coming weeks,” said its spokesperson. He added, “The latest booking patterns on MakeMyTrip indicate that while travellers are willing to postpone their vacation by a few weeks as they monitor the situation, they are still keen on taking a summer holiday with more caution. We are also certain that the distribution and effectiveness of mass vaccination will help in sustaining the recovery that was witnessed in the last quarter.”Moreover, some travel requirements have emerged strong during the pandemic. These are: safety and hygiene at the accommodation, contactless check-in at airports and hotels, and preference for alternative accommodations such as villas and homestays. Also Read | Carnival says not taking stance on mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations for travellersCleartrip has also recorded a drop in bookings amid a rise in Covid cases but expects an upswing in the later months of summer travel .“The current spike in Covid cases and the resulting travel restrictions have resulted in an overall decrease in the demand and slight increase in cancellations. One clear trend being seen is also the spike in one-way travel. However, there is still time for summer bookings to come in, especially with a lot of customers looking to book closer to travel date. We expect the situation to ease as case loads and restrictions recede and vaccination drives gain traction,” said Rajiv Subramanian, vice-president, Cleartrip.With more and more people postponing their travel, booking platforms are looking at offering flexibility in changing itinerary, in order to encourage people to travel.Booking.com, an online travel agency, said options of free or flexible cancellation policies will help travellers update and cancel bookings until 24 hours before check-in at many places.“At Booking.com, our utmost concern is for the safety and security of our customers, partners and colleagues. We are closely monitoring the situation, including announcements and instructions from government and relevant departments, so that we can ensure we are supporting affected parties in any way we can,” said its spokesperson.Thomas Cook has a plan in place. “ With the recent announcements with respect to Mumbai and parts of Maharashtra, we have received a few requests for a possible date change and deferment. Our flexible date change options and rebooking support create reassurance and peace of mind for our customers. The strategic contactless model that we had put in place as early as March-April 2020 is working very well for us,” said Rajeev Kale, president & country head – Holidays, MICE, Visa, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd.However, he also said that they have witnessed a strong growth for domestic holidays with an over 30% increase in March numbers against that of February.

              " ' RBI doubles payments bank balance limit to ₹2 lakh  With the aim to promote digital payments banks in the country, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday announced an increase in the maximum end of day balance for payment banks to ₹2 lakh. The earlier limit, which was in place since 2014, was set at ₹1 lakh per individual customer for the end of the balance for payment banks. RBI decided to enhance the limit of maximum balance based on a review of the performance of these banks which help in increasing financial inclusion. Some of the likely beneficiaries of the step taken by RBI include migrant workers, low-income households, small businesses, and other unorganised groups. The incomes of most of these people have been adversely affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Watch: RBI Monetary Policy: Repo rate, reverse repo rate remain unchanged Payment banks are a type of savings account which can accept a restricted deposit but cannot issue loans or credit cards to customers. Such banks can operate both current as well as saving accounts and can provide all other services like ATM cards, fund transfers, bill payments, recharges, net banking among others to the account holders. Some of the popular payment banks include Paytm Payments bank, Airtel Payments bank, and India Post Payments bank.Read more: RBI extends deadline by six months for e-payment rulesAdditionally, payments banks offer zero balance or no minimum balance accounts without any additional fee and thereby differ from commercial banks which charge fees if the customer does not maintain a minimum balance in their account.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das also announced on Wednesday that the central bank will take steps to make Prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) like wallets interoperable, after which users will be able to transfer money from one wallet to another or from a wallet to your bank account using the centralised payments systems.RBI also announced that it will keep interest rates unchanged, maintaining an accommodative stance. The repo rate has been maintained at 4 per cent and the reverse repo rate is at 3.35 per cent. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics reserve bank of india ',\n",

Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills early on Sunday, catching people at sleep.On nearby Lembata island, the downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja sent solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November to crash down on more than a dozen villages, killing at least 28 and leaving 44 unaccounted for, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.Hundreds of police, soldiers and residents dug through the debris with their bare hands, shovels and hoes searching for those buried. On Tuesday, relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull out a mud-caked body, place it on a bamboo stretcher and take it away for burial.In all, landslides and flooding have killed at least 119 across several islands in Indonesia as well as 27 people in neighboring East Timor. Thousands of homes have been damaged and thousands of people displaced by the weather, which is expected to continue until at least Friday as the storm moves south toward Australia.Rescue efforts were being hampered by the rains and the remoteness of the area, where roads and bridges were damaged in many places.Rescue personnel with excavators and tons of food and medicine were being deployed from Makassar city on Sulawesi island, but were hindered by a lack of sea transportation. National Disaster Mitigation Agency chief Doni Monardo called on the private sector to support relief efforts.Three helicopters began reaching isolated areas of the islands on Tuesday, and President Joko Widodo held a Cabinet meeting in Jakarta to speed up the operation.

              " ' Happy Birthday Jeetendra: A tribute to the ‘Jumping Jack’ of Bollywood  You think of Jeetendra and the first thing that comes to one’s mind is the iconic dance steps. From the fast paced Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq, Hia badminton style sporty dancing in Dhal Gaya Din, the hook and aerobic like dance steps in Naino Mein Sapna and the PT style dancing in Taki Taki, have rightfully earned him the title of Jumping Jack of Bollywood. On his 79th birthday, we talk to a few young choreographers of the country today and know how the veteran actor has inspired them. Dancer-choreographer Melvin Louis Melvin LouisI am a big Jeetu sir fan. Back then not just to be a dancer but to have a distinctive style come out is amazing. The kind of stuff that he did with the energy and expression and the distinctive style, his steps, his turn and walk. It is very iconic even today because that was his own peculiar style which he would add to the choreography. His name is right at the top when it comes to actors with great dancing. For me my favorite song is Dhal Gaya Din (Humjoli, 1970). Actor-dancer Raghav Juyal Raghav JuyalAs an actor and dance he has been always inspiring for me. From my childhood I have always looked upon on him and he is such a flawless performer that his songs makes you groove every time you see. He has given some remarkable dancing moves which I always love to do. My favourite song of Jeetu ji is Taki O Taki (Himmatwala, 1983). Choreographer Punit J Pathak Punit J PathakHe is one of the legends as far as dancing is concerned. He is rightfully called the Jumping Jack because he was always high on energy as far as the songs were concerned. I feel any artiste is more appreciated when the person is genuine and nice so I met him a few time on a dance reality show, he was so nice. There has been no one else like him again. I personally love his song is Naino Mein Sapna (Himmatwala, 1983). Choreographer Kruti Mahesh Kruti MaheshHis style of dancing was unique. Today we see heroes and yes they are good but they try to learn different dance styles and they try and become dancers also but the era for Jeetu ji was such that he had his own style. He had such flamboyance to his dancing and there was no inhibition per say and I got one opportunity to teach him for some video that Ekta Kapoor was doing from home so we had the opportunity to do a couple of steps with him. One of my favourites is Taki O Taki (Himmatwala, 1983). SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' IIT Mandi researchers develop algorithm to optimise vehicle’s fuel efficiency  Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi, have developed an algorithm which they say, can help optimise fuel efficiency and minimise emissions by assessing the functioning of internal combustion (IC) engines. It uses data learning and prediction techniques to calculate real time values about the engine in petrol and diesel vehicles and other subsystems’ performance, says a study.“Based on these performance indicators, the driver of the engine can manoeuvre the vehicle accordingly to improve efficiency and decrease emissions. Automotive engine manufacturers can also programme these algorithms to provide automatic control for better efficiency,” said the lead author of the study, Tushar Jain, assistant professor, School of Computing and Electrical Engineering at IIT Mandi.The development has potential for making significant impact since IC engines fuelled by petrol and diesel comprise 99.8% of global transport, including airplanes and boats. They are also responsible for 10% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2020 study by US and UK-based researchers.“Currently there are no systems to measure efficiency of an engine or other systems in the vehicle. For example, it’s difficult to know exactly how much fuel is flowing into the engine as typical sensors will get damaged during motion since the pistons are constantly moving,” said Jain, whose team comprised research scholar Vyoma Singh and Birupaksha Pal from the Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited (RBEBSPL), Bengaluru. Their work appeared online in the global peer-reviewed International Journal of Systems Science, Taylor & Francis, on February 21. Jain said they are in the process of applying for patents.Amit Shukla, assistant professor, School of Engineering, IIT Mandi, who was not a part of the study, said the estimation of real performance of IC engines is a major challenge and the Jain and his team’s methodology will help to develop better optimised and controlled engines.“Although there is strong intention to move towards electrical energy-based propulsion systems, in reality, we are still far away from that goal of complete electrification of the transportation sector. In such a situation optimisation of IC engine by improving its fuel efficiency, while minimising resultant emission is one of the best near-term solutions,” said Shukla.The researchers have benchmarked the performance of their methodology by comparing it with that of the state-of-the-art estimation methods. The numerical stability and robustness of their proposed methodology are analysed through rigorous Monte Carlo simulations and found to be superior to other methods, said Jain.

              " ' \\'He said I will get better with experience\\': Natarajan recalls Dhoni\\'s advice  A lot of bowlers in Indian cricket have thanked MS Dhoni for their success with the ball. \\'Captain cool\\' Dhoni, like bowlers have said, is not only clever with his field placement but his suggestions to his bowlers tend to work out more often than not. Add T Natarajan to the list. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) pacer Natarajan, ahead of the new Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) season, has revealed how Chennai Super Kings skipper (CSK) Dhoni\\'s advice during IPL 2020 in the UAE helped him hone his skills. Natarajan, who is now known as a yorker specialist, said the former India captain\\'s advice to bowl slower bouncers and cutters made him a better bowler. The Salem-born cricketer bowlerd a whopping 71 yorkers last season, most among pacers, and claimed the prized wickets of Dhoni and de Villiers. \"Speaking to somebody like Dhoni itself is a big thing. He spoke to me about fitness and encouraged me, saying that I will keep getting better with experience. He said, use slow bouncers, cutters, and variations like that. It has been useful for me,\" Natarajan was quoted as saying by \\'ESPNcricinfo\\'.Recalling Dhoni\\'s wicket, he said, \"I pitched one in the slot and he hit me for a big six - 102 metres or something. The next ball I got his wicket (and didn\\'t celebrate) -- I was just thinking about that previous ball.\"After coming back to the dressing room, though, I was happy. After finishing the match, I also had a chat with him.\"One another day during the IPL, the 30-year-old had two big reasons to celebrate. One was dismissing Royal Challengers Bangalore\\'s de Villiers and the other was becoming a father. \"On one side there was my girl and on the other side, I got that wicket in an important knockout game. Romba santhosham (I was extremely happy), but I didn\\'t really tell the others (about the baby).\"I thought I will tell everyone else after we win the game, but my captain (David) Warner spoke about it, I think, at the post-match (presentation),\" Natarajan said.Natarajan finished with 16 wickets in as many matches last year.

              " ' Local lockdowns, inflation, GDP growth: What RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das during the Monetary Policy Committee(MPC) statement made several announcements to boost the economic recovery of the country and enhance digital platforms for the access of all.Here are the key highlights of the governor’s statement:First and foremost of all, the central bank maintained the status quo in the repo rate as it stands unchanged at 4 per cent and the reverse repo rate stands at 3.35 per cent. He said the MPC unanimously decided to keep the rates unchanged to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The governor of the central bank said the projection of the real GDP growth for the fiscal period of 2021-2020 is retained at 10.5 per cent. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected India’s growth rate to jump to 12.5 per cent in 2021.Also Read | Sensex climbs 300 points after RBI policy outcome; Nifty jumps over 14,750 level“The recent surge in Covid-19 cases adds uncertainty to the domestic growth outlook amid tightening of restrictions by some state governments,” Das said, adding that regional lockdowns and restrictions can delay the return to normalcy. The bank will support the market with adequate liquidity, Das also said.Das said the government retained the inflation target at four per cent with the lower and upper tolerance levels of two and six per cents respectively, for the next five years from April 2021- March 2026.The governor also announced several additional measures ‘with a view to nurture recovery’ as stated in developmental and regulatory policy.The additional measures include fresh lending of ₹50,000 crore to all Indian financial institutions like NABARD, National Housing Bank (NHB), and Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to maintain a continuous flow of credit.The renewed jump in Covid-19 infections in certain parts of the country and the associated localised lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary.The governor also announced the extension of the deadline for the TLTRO scheme by six months to September 30.Further, the bank has also extended the use of central payment systems like RTGS and NEFT to non-banking service providers like PPIs and trade platforms regulated by the RBI.Also Read | RBI clears ₹21,658 cr CCL for PunjabTo check the financial inclusion index, the governor said an FCI report will be created and published every year in July for the year ending in previous March.The maximum end-of-day balance for payments banks has also been increased from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh by the RBI.Showing interest in the potential of asset reconstruction companies (ARC), Das said a committee will be formed to review the working of ARCs.The governor also urged the market players to be aware of every communication from the central bank and said the bank will take all measures necessary to \"insulate domestic financial markets from global spillover.\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics reserve bank of india shaktikanta das ',\n",

She talked about getting typecast in comedy films and her unsuccessful attempt to break out of that mould.In an interview with a leading daily, Rimi said that she doesn't like being in the public eye and chose a career in films only because she ‘wanted to make money’. Having found success in comedies such as Hungama, Garam Masala, Deewane Huye Paagal and Golmaal: Fun Unlimited, she was offered similar kinds of films but she got ‘tired’ of doing them.Although Rimi tried to take up serious roles in Johnny Gaddaar, Sankat City and Shagird, the films did not fare well at the box office. “When I wanted to do serious work, I approached Sriram Raghavan, Tigmanshu Dhulia but unfortunately those films were way ahead of their time and didn’t work out, so my options were again closed,” she said.Rimi revealed that she auditioned for Swades and Munna Bhai MBBS but did not get the roles. “I had done a commercial with Ashutosh Gowariker, so I had a cordial relationship with him and hence I also auditioned for Swades. But later on, Gayatri Joshi got it. I had also auditioned for Munna Bhai MBBS and had even received a positive response also for it, but eventually Gracy Singh played the part.

              " ' Private car is a public place, masks mandatory even when driving alone: Delhi HC  It is compulsory for people to wear a mask in a private vehicle even if they are driving alone, the Delhi High Court ordered on Wednesday, ruling that a private vehicle on the roads is also covered under the definition of a public place.The high court also chided four lawyers who petitioned the high court last year against fines imposed by the Delhi Police for violating the mask rule, observing that compliance by lawyers encourages common people also to wear the masks needed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.Justice Prathiba M Singh said a private vehicle on the road is a public place and it is mandatory to wear a mask even when one is travelling alone in the car. “A mask acts as a suraksha kavach (protective shield) which would prevent the spread of the deadly virus,” the high court said, recalling that several experts, doctors and researchers have emphasised on the need to wear face masks right from the early days of the pandemic.Saurabh Sharma, a lawyer who was fined ₹500 for not wearing a mask last year, had challenged the penalty in his petition filed in September last year. Sharma said the officers who imposed the fine had failed to provide any executive order to establish that it was mandatory to wear masks while travelling alone in a private vehicle.Sharma’s petition echoed a view that had been articulated by many people on and off social media who argued that people should be allowed to take off their masks when driving alone.The central government, which had first made it compulsory for people to wear masks in public places in April last year, did not take a stand and left it to state governments to see how they wanted to implement the rule. Residents of the national capital, however, have reservations about the high court ruling.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi’s joint RWA forum, said the decision was “not fair”. “We have no option other than to obey the court order. But I think wearing a mask while driving a car with all windows closed should not be made mandatory. When all windows of a car are closed and the person is in the vehicle then it is a private environment. The court should also take cognisance of political rallies and protests where hardly anyone is seen wearing masks or following social distancing norms,” Vohra said.Sanjay Rana, president of Greater Kailash-2 RWA, echoed Vohra’s statement, and said, “I feel that masks should be mandatory when a person is driving alone with the windows open; but if all windowpanes are closed and the driver is alone in the car, then there should be no such compulsion. The court should do something about crowding in markets and other public places as it poses more danger than a single man driving a car.”A day before Saurabh Sharma filed his petition, the Chandigarh administration told police personnel to stop prosecuting people for not wearing masks if they are alone in the car.In this case, the Delhi government supported the prosecution of the lawyers during proceedings in the high court.It is not clear if the Delhi high court’s ruling would persuade other states to review their stand on this issue.Political parties seem to have opposing views on the ruling. Mudit Aggrawal, vice-president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, said, “I would urge the court to reconsider their decision… This would lead to unnecessary harassment and corruption without any actual benefits in controlling Covid-19 cases.” He added that by this logic, people must wear masks even at home especially if the door and windows are open.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, welcomed the decision.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We support the court’s ruling. We have even run mask and sanitiser distribution campaigns. We call upon our workers to encourage use of masks by distributing them wherever they are needed.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' UK\\'s Glastonbury Festival, cinemas, museums get government cash to survive Covid  Entertainment venues across Britain were forced to close last March because of the coronavirus crisis and while some partially reopened last summer, many have remained shut since then.Last July, the government unveiled a 1.57 billion pound ($2.2 billion) Culture Recovery Fund (CRF) package of grants and loans, and on Friday detailed where the latest tranche of funding would be spent.Among the recipients is Glastonbury, the largest greenfield music festival in the world, which has been forced to cancel for two years running. It will receive 900,000 pounds to help carry it through to 2022.\"This grant will make a huge difference in helping to secure our future,\" founder Michael Eavis and daughter Emily said in a statement.Tens of millions of pounds have been made available to theatres, while the English Heritage Trust, which looks after 420 historic monuments, buildings, and objects, will receive 23.4 million pounds.The British Film Institute has also awarded 6.5 million to help independent cinemas.The government says the CRF has helped protect more than 75,000 jobs and ensure thousands of organisations survive the Covid crisis.\"Now we’re staying by their side as they prepare to welcome the public back through their doors,\" culture minister Oliver Dowden said.Under the government\\'s pandemic \"roadmap\", it is hoped many venues will be able to reopen to live audiences from mid-May and the latest funding is designed to help theatres, museums and comedy clubs make necessary preparations.The government was accused last month of being too slow to hand out CRF money to recipients, with parliament\\'s spending watchdog saying only 495 million pounds of the first 1 billion pound tranche had been paid out by late February.The culture department said nearly all the 1.57 billion pounds had now been allocated.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' From Munger to NCR, an inside account of how Delhi’s criminals source their arms  Till a decade ago, the illegal arms factories of Munger in Bihar almost always found a way in the confessions of criminals caught with guns in Delhi. Today, Munger, about 1,200km from Delhi, is no longer a source of concern for the police in the national capital, for the trend of Delhi’s criminals sourcing weapons from Bihar’s infamous factories has dissipated, according to key police officials.But that’s where the good news ends. The police have a bigger worry. In Delhi, when, on an average, there are at least two incidents involving the use of firearms in crimes every day, factories have now mushroomed in the vicinity of the capital itself. Those who ran the small arms factories in Munger have now joined hands and trained people in western Uttar Pradesh. HT spoke to many police officers, both retired and serving, to understand the market of illegal gun trade in Delhi. The last time Munger’s illegal firearm factories were in the headlines was in March 2020, when a 7.65 bore countrymade pistol was seized from the house of Shahrukh Pathan, the north east Delhi resident whose video of pointing the gun at a policeman during Delhi riots went viral on the internet — the pistol was manufactured in Munger. A year later, the Delhi Police have not been able to arrest the person from whom Pathan had purchased the gun or locate the factory in Munger where it was manufactured, despite multiple visits to the district.“This is because illegal gun factories in Munger have got crippled in the last five-six years and those skilled in the trade have shifted themselves to other states. They are now adopting newer strategies to earn their livelihood. In fact, the skilled labourers of those factories are now being hired by gun runners who are operating from Delhi’s neighbourhood such as Meerut and Aligarh,” said a crime branch officer. From Munger to west UPBetween 2012 and 2015, the Delhi Police’s special cell and crime branch teams would make at least two visits every month to Munger to bust owners of illegal gun factories, arrest gunrunners and people involved in the trafficking chain, following any recovery of illicit firearms in Delhi. These days, the teams hardly visit the district once a year.But the use of illicit arms in street crimes such as robbery and dacoity in the national capital, or the numbers of seizure of such guns, has not gone down. What has happened is that manufacturing units have come closer to clients, police officers working on gunrunning rackets said.Also Read | Man wanted in 39 criminal cases arrested after brief exchange of fire with policeEarlier, illegal gun factories of Munger catered to 60% to 70% of total supply of illicit guns in Delhi and its neighbouring states while Madhya Pradesh’s Khargone, Khandwa, Burhanpur and Dhar were the secondary suppliers. But in the last two-three years, the trend has changed. Gunrunners based in Meerut, Aligarh and a few other places in western Uttar Pradesh are now catering to a majority of the demands of illicit firearms by criminals in Delhi-NCR.This is also evident from the fact that Delhi Police and UP Police have been taking action against illegal gun factories and gunrunners in recent times in this area. On March 27, the UP Police seized 133 illicit firearms after busting four illegal gun factories and arresting eight gunrunners in Meerut.A week before that, Delhi Police arrested five men with three countrymade pistols, which, the men revealed, they had procured from one Aamir Saifi, a gunrunner based in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut. Just five days before their arrest, the same team had seized 10 guns from six arrested persons, including a trafficker of illicit firearms — it was during their questioning that the name of Aamir Saifi as a key supplier of the weapons surfaced. Similarly, in June last year, an illegal mini-arms factory with 516 firearm barrels, 10 manufactured pistols, and lots of manufacturing parts, was busted in Aligarh following a joint raid by Delhi’s special cell and Aligarh police.Decoding the shift There are various reasons behind the shifting of illegal gun factories from Munger to Delhi’s outskirts. But the primary among them were the non-stop raids, seizures and arrests in Munger by the Bihar police as well as police from other states, and the proximity between the suppliers and the clients, experts as well as police officers from Bihar and Delhi said.“The last prominent raid in Munger was carried out last year, when the Delhi Police teams camped in the district for several days to arrest the gunrunner through whom Shahrukh Pathan (mentioned above) had purchased the pistol that he had pointed at a policeman during the Delhi riots. Since then, no state police have carried out any operation in Munger. These days, mostly notices are received from other state police following the arrest of Munger’s illegal gun manufacturers in their states,” said Manavjit Singh Dhillon, superintendent of police (Munger).Also Read | 5 hitmen, part of Lawrence Bishnoi gang, arrested in north DelhiRetired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Ashok Chand said that the Delhi Police’s crackdown on gun factories in Munger started in 2012 following a murder case wherein a man allegedly killed his wife and in-laws using a countrymade pistol that was found to be manufactured in Munger. With that information and the fact that a majority of the illegal firearms seized during that period had Munger links, the then police chief Neeraj Kumar directed the special cell and crime branch teams to neutralise the entire nexus, said Chand.“For the next three-four years, Delhi and Munger police carried out incessant drives against illegal gun factories, forcing criminals involved in the unlawful trade to shift their bases and adopt newer strategies to run their business,” said Chand.Between 2017 and 2018, at least 125 AK-47s, fabricated from parts of weapons presumably phased out or condemned by the army and dumped in its stores in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, reached Bihar’s Munger and then found their way into the hands of Maoists and gangsters. The recovery of many such guns and arrests of some key players grabbed the government’s attention and the national investigation agency (NIA) was roped in to investigate the matter.“The crackdown that followed nearly wiped out the deadly arms factories from the district and a majority of the skilled labourers shifted,” said another Delhi Police’s crime branch officer.The new operational manual Even as the illegal gun trade from Munger has declined, it has led to dislocation rather — with people involved in the manufacturing, supply and sale of firearms now hiring skilled workers from Munger, and shifting them to places around Delhi, thereby creating newer fabrication hubs, smaller in scale and more dispersed.As most of the firearms were caught during their transit, the gunrunners adopted the strategy of looking for safe zones around Delhi. The gunrunners look for low income group neighbourhoods, take houses on rent for three-four months, set up their machines and begin assembling firearms, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.“Many of the gunrunners we have arrested and interrogated in the last two-three years revealed that they hire blacksmiths from Munger skilled in manufacturing sophisticated guns, procure raw materials such as springs, butt and barrels from different places and assemble the guns in their temporary gun factories,” said Yadav.Unlike earlier, when gunrunners used to transit bigger consignments from Munger or Madhya Pradesh, suppliers have now become careful and take many precautions while adopting newer ways to smuggle illegal weapons into Delhi. They mostly procure raw materials from their older hubs, and the assemble guns at rented places around Delhi. Deals between clients and supplies are no longer happening in open telephone calls but encrypted mobile applications to avoid police attention and stay away from their radar.Analysis of confessional statements reveal that traffickers of illegal firearms avoid taking the border routes which are under close police watch. When railways are used, the operators prefer not to land at the stations located in Delhi but get down at stoppages just before Delhi and from there, use local public transport to enter the city.In many cases, women accompany the male carriers and they pose as couples to avoid police attention while travelling in private vehicles or in public transport. Police have also found that hiding the illegal firearms in special cavities created in a car doors or boot is another way of smuggling such weapons.The costingAssembling a pistol takes just a day or two and the total investment is between ₹2,000 and ₹3,000. The gun is finally sold at prices ranging between ₹20,000 and ₹30,000, depending on its quality. The high profit margin has made this illegal business lucrative, attracting people who want to become rich overnight, said Chand, who last served in Delhi Police’s crime branch.Over a decade ago, the demands of firearms in Delhi and other north Indian states were fulfilled not only by the gunrunners based in Munger or Madhya Pradesh—supplies also came from Pakistan. Earlier, foreign-made firearms, mostly Chinese guns, were in high demand among gangsters and criminals because their quality was seen to be better than the crude pistols manufactured in India’s illegal factories. “And it was the reason that even Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists had involved themselves in the illegal trade. One illegal firearm manufacturing factory that was set up by IM’s co-founder Yasin Bhatkal was busted by the Delhi Police in 2011. I was on the force then and many such operations were carried out across the country,” said Chand.But as the smuggled foreign-made guns were costly and risky to traffick across borders, the gunrunners in India started using good metal and materials to manufacture guns of better quality. “Unlike the previous crudely made pistols, the barrels of these sophisticated pistols do not burst after one or two shots or cause injuries to the users,” explained Chand.The impact on Delhi’s crime scene Even as the Delhi Police data shows that the use of firearms in crimes in the city has decreased over the past three-four years, on an average, two crimes, in which firearms were used, were reported everyday in this period.Police data shows that firearms were used in 672 crimes in 2020 while in 2019 this number was 736. Similarly, there were 897 cases of use of firearms in crimes in 2017 and the number came down to 810 the following year (2018).In March 2021 alone, there have been at least 20 cases wherein firearms were used for street crimes such as robbery and snatching or heinous crimes like murder and attempt to murder. On March 25, a group of seven-eight assailants opened fire at a police team at GTB Hospital in their bid to release a jailed gangster. On March 23, in a suspected gang rivalry case, four motorcycle-borne assailants fired nearly two dozen bullets in south Delhi’s Dakshinpuri to kill a 31-year-old meat shop owner. Around a week ago, a 45-year-old chartered accountant was shot dead at his under construction building in Adarsh Nagar during a robbery bid. On March 12, two armed men who were out for snatching fired and injured a policeman after he tried to stop their motorcycle and overpower them in Defence Colony area.These incidents show that criminals carrying firearms become violent even during snatching a gold chain or a mobile phone. They do not hesitate in firing on the police as well.Be it crude or refined, guns continue to be the favourite weapon of criminals, as they are the ultimate display of power for them. There is no better way of defining the stature of a criminal than by mentioning what kind of weapons he posses or uses, says deputy commissioner of police (crime) Chinmoy Biswal, who is also Delhi Police’s spokesperson.But Biswal also said that police have launched a massive crackdown on illegal guns and the number of weapons every year is proof of that.

              " ' Heart patients three times more likely to have diabetes: Study  Nearly 30 per cent of patients with coronary artery disease have diabetes, according to the study. That compares to a diabetes prevalence of around 9 per cent in the general population. There was wide geographical variation, with 60 per cent of heart disease patients in Gulf countries having diabetes compared to 20 per cent in Europe.\"Obesity and lack of exercise are common risk factors for both diabetes and heart disease and our results highlight the urgent need to improve nutrition and raise activity levels globally,\" said study author Dr Emmanuelle Vidal-Petiot of Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France.Vidal-Petiot added, \"Countries worst affected by diabetes are also at the epicentre of the obesity epidemic, which can be in part attributed to urbanisation and associated changes in physical activity and food intake.\"This was an analysis of the CLARIFY registry, which included 32,694 patients with chronic coronary syndromes from 45 countries in Europe, Asia, America, the Middle East, Australia, and Africa. Patients were enrolled from 2009 to 2010 and followed up yearly for five years.All adverse clinical outcomes measured in the study occurred more frequently among heart patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. When the researchers compared the likelihood of poor outcomes in those with diabetes compared to those without, they adjusted the analyses for multiple factors that could influence the relationship including age, sex, smoking status, body mass index, blood pressure, medications, and other conditions.After these adjustments, they found that among patients with stable coronary heart disease, those with diabetes had a 38 per cent higher rate of death during the five-year follow-up.They also had a 28 per cent higher risk of the combined outcome of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular cause. Heart patients with diabetes had worse outcomes than those without diabetes regardless of geographic region and ethnicity.Dr Vidal-Petiot said, \"Diabetes was linked with worse outcomes even in areas with the lowest prevalence. In Europe, for instance, diabetes was linked with a 29 per cent greater risk of the combined outcome of heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death. This indicates that management of these very high-risk patients with heart disease and diabetes should be improved. Each country needs to identify these patients and provide tailored educational and prevention programmes.\"She concluded, \"The importance of healthy eating and living cannot be overemphasised. Everyone can lower their chances of developing diabetes with weight control and exercise, and early detection is needed so that blood sugar can be controlled. Those with heart disease and diabetes also need an active lifestyle and a good diet to protect their health. Avoiding smoking is crucial, as is controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\"Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " \" Kim Jong Un says North Korea facing its 'worst-ever situation'  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has acknowledged his country was facing the “worst-ever situation” as he addressed thousands of grassroots members of his ruling party during a major political conference in Pyongyang.Experts say Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade in rule, with North Korea's coronavirus lockdown unleashing further shock on an economy devastated by decades of mismanagement and crippling U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons programme.The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim made the comments during an opening speech at a meeting of the Workers' Party's cell secretaries on Tuesday.“Improving the people's living standards ... even in the worst-ever situation in which we have to overcome unprecedentedly numerous challenges depends on the role played by the cells, the grassroots organizations of the party,” Kim said.He urged members to carry out the decisions made at a party congress in January, when he vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of US pressure and announced a new five-year national development plan. The congress came months after Kim during another political conference showed unusual candor by acknowledging that his plans to improve the economy weren't succeeding.During Tuesday's speech, Kim also criticised the party's grassroots units for unspecified “shortcomings” that should be immediately corrected to ensure the “healthy and sustainable” development of the party.Party cells, which consist of five to 30 members, are the smallest units of party authority that oversee the works and lives at factories and other places. The network is an important tool for Workers' Party to perpetuate its power. The previous conference of cell secretaries was held in 2017.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with former President Donald Trump, which collapsed over disagreements in lifting sanctions for the North's denuclearization steps.The North has so far rejected the Biden administration's overture for talks, saying that Washington must discard its “hostile” policies first, and dialed up pressure by resuming tests of ballistic missiles last month after a yearlong pause.

              " ' World Health Day 2021: 5 Yoga exercises to beat laziness, procrastination  There is no better day to introspect about our deteriorating fitness levels than on World Health Day 2021 which is being marked on April 7. Initially, we thought it was the changing weather but summer has arrived and settled in long back which confirms the fact that this constant procrastination or postponement of difficult tasks is not occasional, instead it is turning out to be a permanent state given the Covid-19 curfews or lockdowns, social distancing norms and total technology dependence.While the Covid-19 lockdown in the past year drove up stress and anxiety, this year it is evidently leaving us unenthusiastic to get things done and our motivation is on the ebb. This Wednesday on World Health Day 2021, we chalked up 5 Yoga exercises to beat lazy excuses like ‘Will do it tomorrow’, ‘Maybe next week’, ‘Will finish it soon’ or simply to keep procrastination at bay:1. Balasana or Child\\'s Pose or Child\\'s Resting Pose of YogaMethod: Sit on your heels on the floor or a yoga mat and keep your knees either together or wide apart. Slowly, exhale and bend forward to touch the floor with your forehead or rest it on a block or two stacked fists while keeping your arms alongside your body and palms facing up.Alternatively, you can keep your palms facing down on the mat by reaching out your arms towards the front of the yoga mat. Now, if your knees are together, gently press your chest on the thighs or press your chest between the thighs if the knees are apart.Relax the shoulders, jaw and eyes and find a comfortable place for the forehead as there is an energy point at its center, in between the eyebrows, that supports a \"rest and digest\" response by stimulating the vagus nerve. Hold onto the pose for as long as you like and pull your navel towards your spine while inhaling and softening your body and the arms while exhaling. Return to the sitting position on the heels slowly while inhaling and as if uncurling the spine. Balasana or Child\\'s Pose or Child\\'s Resting Pose of Yoga(Instagram/mindfulbyminna) Benefits: This beginner’s Yoga pose not only helps to reduce stress and anxiety by helps releasing the tension in the chest, back and shoulders but also helps if you have a bout of dizziness or fatigue during the day or during your workout. It can help relieve back pain as it is a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs and ankles.Precautions: This exercise is not recommended for pregnant women or those suffering from diarrhea or knee injury,2. Bhujangasana or Cobra pose of YogaMethod: Lie down flat on your stomach. Rest your palms by the side of your chest, arms close to your body, elbows pointing outward. Inhale and raise your forehead, neck and shoulders.Raise your trunk using the strength of your arms. Look upward while breathing normally. Make sure that your stomach is pressed on the floor. Hold the pose for 5 seconds. Slowly lie back flat on your stomach. Turn your head to one side and rest your arms by the side of your body. Bhujangasana or Cobra pose of Yoga(Instagram/cronesima) Benefits: The reclining back-bending asana of Yoga called Bhujangasana or Cobra pose strengthens the spine, butt, butt muscles, chest, abdomen, shoulders, lungs and improves blood circulation while also releasing the stress in one’s body.Precautions: Though it is also a useful remedy for asthma patients, it is not to be performed during an asthma attack.3. Viparita Karni or legs-up-the-wall pose of YogaMethod: Lie straight on your back. Join both the legs and lift them up. Take the legs slightly behind to lift your lower back. Support the back by placing the palms on the lower back with elbows on the ground. Keep the legs perpendicular to the floor and your back inclined at an angle of 45-60 degrees with the floor. Breathe normally. Begin with 1-minute and then slowly increase the duration of practice to 10 minutes. Viparita Karni or legs-up-the-wall pose of Yoga(Instagram/drivenbydani) Benefits: This asana enables quicker movement of water from the small intestine to the larger intestine, which cleanses the stomach. It is also a great practice to stimulate the hormone system and strengthen the core. It allows you to completely relax your mind and body and helps to cool it down while refreshing the circulatory system.This pose also helps in easing lower back pains, swollen ankles and varicose veins which are a common symptom of pregnancy.Precautions: In case you suffer from severe eye problems such as glaucoma or have serious neck and back pains, do not perform this asana.4. Vrikshasana or tree pose of YogaMethod: Balance yourself on one leg, with the other one folded and supported on your inner thigh. Stretch out your hands above your head and point them directly upwards.Clasp them together in anjali mudra. Gaze in the distance, shift the weight to your left leg while keeping the right knee bent in half lotus position and hold onto this posture for a few seconds before releasing and repeating the same with the alternate leg. Vrikshasana or tree pose of Yoga(Twitter/soulsaanch) Benefits: This asana helps to bring balance to your mind and body. It makes your legs stronger and is a great hip opener as assists it the body in establishing pelvic stability and strengthens the bones of the hips and legs.The shift of the entire body’s weight to each leg strengthens the ligaments and tendon of the feet. It also helps strengthen the thighs, calves and ankles and and helps improve focus.Precautions: This asana should be avoided by those who suffer from vertigo or migraine or insomnia issues. Pregnant women can practice Vrikshasana till their second trimester but should avoid it in their last trimester.5. Padmasana or lotus pose of YogaMethod: Sit on the floor or on a Yoga mat with legs stretched out and spine erect. Bend the right knee and place it on the left thigh with the sole of the feet point upward and the heel close to the abdomen.Repeat the same step with the other leg and place your hands on the knees in mudra position. Keeping the head straight and spine erect, close your eyes and take gentle long breaths in and out.To promote a meditative state, breathe in and out deeply through your nose during this pose and switch legs by spending equal amounts of time with the opposite positioning. Since a lotus pose or Padmasana is not readily accessible to many practitioners, especially for people with tricky knees, half lotus is pretty comfortable and a good substitute of yoga’s most iconic postures. Padmasana or lotus pose of Yoga(Instagram/agora.yoga) Benefits: This pose helps promote good posture and maintains flexibility in one’s gluteal muscles along with the deep rotator muscles of hips. Since any vigorous activity like running can tighten the piriformis, half lotus pose helps in stretching it.The piriformis can also be tightened due to inactivity by sitting too much. This asana opens the hips and stretches the feet and ankles.Precautions: Padmasana should not be performed by those who have knee injury or any form of injury in the ankle or calf or those suffering from any back or spine discomfort or suffering from sciatica infections or weakness in the sciatic nerves.Opting for a less strenuous activity or just remaining idle is natural at times but when it becomes prolonged due to hormonal deficiencies or environmental factors, it could become a problem and interfere with the proper functioning of the individual. Hence, these Yoga exercises are important.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics world health day yoga yoga asanas yoga exercise exercises laziness procrastination covid-19 lockdown curfew social distancing bhujangasana cobra pose viparita karni vrikshasana tree pose padmasana workout goal workout fitness motivation fitness goals fitness inspiration fitness goal fitness tips fitness healthy coronvirus stress relief anxiety + 27 more ',\n",

              " ' Zeishan Quadri: The film industry was, is, and will remain biased  He has dabbled in the film industry in different capacities — he wrote the story for the cult film Gangs of Wasseypur, acted in it, and directed a film called Meeruthiya Gangster, too. And recently, Zeishan Quadri produced a film called Halahal.Like every business, films, too, demand return on investment at the end of the day. In such a scenario, has Quadri been able to do and make the kind of projects that he wants to, minus the glamour or masala associated with mainstream cinema?He says, “It’s simple and straight. All producers want their money back and now the industry is divided into OTT and feature films. When you say you want our money back, you’re not more than a line producer when you’re doing something for an OTT, because it’s completely their thing once they buy it. They give you money to produce. But you have creative freedom, can take calls. Yahaan pe aake flop hone ki possibility kam ho gayi hai.”And when that fear of failure is gone, he adds that the content automatically improves.“See the kind of shows that are being made. Then there are people like me, who make small films like Halahal, with a small budget. Even after promotions, people don’t pay attention to it,” rues the 38-year-old.Quadri also reveals that the film was snubbed at mainstream affairs.“Critics ne bhar bhar ke Halahal ko appreciate kiya. At the same time, it didn’t go to any awards. The films which won however, you’ll laugh how they got a nomination. Film industry biased thi, hai aur rahegi. Isse mujhe na kabhi farq padha tha, nah hai aur na padhega. I’ll make the kind of cinema and films I want. Till your things aren’t appreciated by Bollywood, the name given to the film industry — when they do that, audience for our films increases. Confidence of people like us gets a boost and we make more of such films. But Rome was not built in a day,” he ends on a thoughtful note. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The bench of Justice Pratibha M Singh said a mask acts as Suraksha Kavach, which would prevent the spread of the deadly virus.\"Wearing of a mask of a face cover in a vehicle, which may be occupied by either a single person or multiple persons, is... compulsory in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" the order said.Also watch | \\'Delhi Police will strictly enforce night curfew, issue fresh passes\\': PRO \\ufeffWhile dismissing the petitions, the court also chided the lawyers of the petitions challenging the mandatory mask rule.

Even after vaccination, one must not do away with the masks, the court said, adding that immediately after the outbreak of the pandemic, it was reiterated that wearing a mask is of paramount importance.In November 2020, when advocate Saurabh Sharma filed a petition against the challan of ₹500 and sought a compensation of ₹10 lakh, the Delhi government maintained that a personal vehicle is not a private zone.The ruling comes at a time when the Capital is witnessing a fresh surge in the number of daily infections and a night curfew from 10pm to 5am has been imposed in the city.

Prachi has said that she is open to the idea of it but only if she finds someone perfect.Speaking to a leading daily, Prachi said a marriage of convenience has never been on her agenda. \"My parents have brought me up in such a way that I never saw marriage as a safety net or as something I would do if my career slowed down for a bit or something didn’t work out,\" she said.\"You know, I have been married so many times on screen that I think I am done with it for now.

After that, she was seen in films such as Rock On and Azhar. Recently, she spoke to Hindustan Times about the pressures of being an actor. “Had I let that pressure get to me, I would have agreed to all the offers that came to me. I got many roles with great directors and stories but I felt the role wouldn’t benefit me in any way. The roles didn’t add anything to my career so I’d to let go of those films. It comes from the space of being strong minded and knowing what I want. Being the limelight wasn’t my goal as anyway I shy away from it. I don’t socialise a lot and kept my communication limited,” she said.She is currently seen on the web series Silence, with Manoj Bajpayee. She plays a police officer on the show.

Department spokesman Ned Price said earlier the consultations were being held in order to present a united front.\"Part of our review of those Olympics and our thinking will involve close consultations with partners and allies around the world,\" Price told reporters.Human rights groups are protesting China\\'s hosting of the Games, which are set to start in February 2022. They have urged a diplomatic or straight-up boycott of the event to call attention to alleged Chinese abuses against Uyghurs, Tibetans, and residents of Hong Kong.Price declined to say when a decision pm the Olympics might be made, but noted there is still almost a year until the Games are set to begin.\"These Games remain some time away. I wouldn\\'t want to put a timeframe on it, but these discussions are underway,\" he said.\"It is something that we certainly wish to discuss and it is certainly something that we understand that a coordinated approach will be not only in our interest, but also in the interest of our allies and partners.

              " ' Vivad se Vishwas solved 1.48 lakh legacy disputes, ₹54K crore recovered: CBDT  The direct tax dispute resolution scheme ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ (from dispute to trust) has settled more than 1.48 lakh cases and recovered 54% of about ₹1 lakh crore amount under litigation, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Pramod Chandra Mody said on Tuesday.“The scheme has been successful as its objective was to reduce pending income tax litigation, generate timely revenue and provide taxpayers peace of mind,” he said.The scheme started on March 17, 2020 and closed on March 31 this year. However, taxpayers, who have already made declarations within the stipulated deadline of March 31, can make payments without any penalty or interest up to April 30, 2021.The Vivad se Vishwas scheme provides for the settlement of disputed tax, interest, penalty or fees in relation to an assessment or reassessment order. It grants immunity to taxpayers from levy of interest, penalty and institution of any proceeding for prosecution for any offence under the Income-Tax Act in respect of matters covered in the declaration.According to an official data, the government received a total 1,33,837 applications under the scheme, involving a total of 1,48,690 disputes. 1,45,237 disputes were related to appeals by assesses and 3,453 were related to appeals by the income-tax department. While the total disputed amount was ₹1,00,437 crore, the government received ₹54,005 crore in payments against the disputed tax. As on January 31, 2020, there were over 5.10 lakh litigations pending in various forums involving over ₹19.5 lakh crore. CBDT chairman Mody said that disputes over assessments were the root cause of litigation and technology and faceless assessments were making the process more objective, which was likely to reduce disputes.Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Company, said, “Vivad se Vishwas scheme has been a successful scheme that resolved several litigations quickly and settled the matter amicably. Any other approach would have prolonged these litigations.”Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the scheme in the Union budget presented on February 1, 2020 with the aim to resolve legacy disputes involving direct taxes. Under the scheme, penalty and interest were to be waived if the disputed amount was paid before the stipulated date.“This year, I propose to bring a scheme similar to the indirect tax scheme ‘Sabka Vishwas’ for reducing litigations even in the direct taxes,” Sitharaman said in her budget speech last year. On July 5, 2019, Sitharaman had proposed the ‘Sabka Vishwas’ legacy dispute resolution scheme for excise and service tax, which resulted in settling at least 189,000 cases.

              " ' Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari brought back to Banda jail from Punjab  After spending more than two years in Punjab’s Rupnagar prison, gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, 57, was brought back to Banda jail in Uttar Pradesh (UP) early Wednesday by road. Ansari’s return to Banda jail was in compliance with a March 26 Supreme Court order directing his transfer to UP where he faces trials in several criminal cases.The nearly 840 kilometre road journey took a little over 14 hours with Ansari, a five term MLA, in an ambulance that was part of the motorcade comprising GPS-enabled Vajra anti-riot vehicle, and gun-toting security personnel. About 100 policemen, including two deputy superintendents of police, and six sub inspectors, escorted the Bahujan Samaj Party MLA from Mau. The motorcade made only two stoppages in Agra – where drivers were changed – and then briefly in Satti in Kanpur. Also Read | ‘Mukhtar Ansari was given poison in same Banda jail,’ says his brotherAccording to Banda circle officer (CO) Banda Rakesh Singh, only the ambulance carrying Ansari and another vehicle were allowed to go inside the heavily guarded jail gates. Banda jail superintendent PK Tripathi said Ansari has been kept away from others in barrack number 15. He said security staff around Ansari would be sporting body worn cameras. Before being shifted out to Punjab jail two years ago, Ansari was lodged in this jail. While he was served food from outside then, this time, for security and medical reasons, he would be served prison food, jail officials said. Earlier new CCTV cameras were installed in Banda jail. “All the 19 cameras inside the jail have been changed or repaired,” a jail staff said, adding that strict watch was being kept on all visitors. A day ago, Ansari’s wife, Afshan Ansari, approached the Supreme Court, seeking a direction to the UP Police to “not kill” her husband in a fake encounter and allow him to face a “free and fair trial”. She pleaded that Ansari be provided security also during his transportation to court for trial proceedings. Her plea is likely to come up for hearing within a week or so.

              " ' CBI may record Param Bir Singh’s statement in Bombay HC-directed inquiry today  A six-member team of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which arrived in Mumbai from Delhi on Tuesday, is expected to record the statement of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in the preliminary inquiry ordered by the Bombay high court on April 5. The high court had ordered the inquiry based on a petition filed by city-based lawyer Dr Jaishri Patil seeking a probe into Singh’s allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh in his March 20 letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Dr Patil had approached the high court after the Malabar Hill police failed to take cognizance of her March 21 letter seeking the registration of an FIR against Deshmukh. Dr Patil, in her petition, not only sought directions to the Malabar Hill police station to register an offence but also sought a CBI probe into the allegations. Also Read | Deshmukh, Maha govt move SC against high court’s order for CBI probeThe bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni in its 52-page order delivered on April 5 observed that as the police force was under home minister Deshmukh there could not be an unfair, impartial and unbiased inquiry and hence directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry within 15 days. The court, however, restrained the CBI from registering an FIR based on Dr Patil’s complaint. The court also left it to the discretion of the director of CBI to decide on the further course of action after the preliminary inquiry. After arriving in Mumbai on Tuesday, the CBI registered a preliminary inquiry and is expected to start recording the statements of Singh and other officers mentioned by Singh in his allegations. The statement of Dr Patil will also be recorded by the six CBI officers. The high court noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' \\'Very disappointing, hasn\\'t succeeded in IPL\\': Gambhir on RCB\\'s ₹14.25 Cr buy  Former India opener Gautam Gambhir said the ‘most unfortunate thing’ about Glenn Maxwell is that the Australian has not able to perform in the IPL despite being presented with the ideal platform to express himself. Gambhir’s comments came days before the opening match of IPL 2021 between Royal Challenger Bangalore – Maxwell’s new home in the IPL – and defending champions Mumbai Indians.Comparing Maxwell with another big-ticket all-rounder in the IPL, Andre Russell, who has been a part of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) since 2014, Gambhir said the Australian big-hitter has been very disappointing throughout the IPL.Also Read | Dawid Malan interview: \\'Being world No. 1 does not mean you can score 40-ball tons every time\\'“The most unfortunate thing is that despite getting that platform, he has not succeeded, apart from that one season in 2014 where he set the IPL on fire. Had he done that, I think none of the franchises would have released him. Look at what Andre Russell has done for KKR and the amount of time he\\'s spent at one franchise,” Gambhir told ESPNCricinfo.Maxwell has scored more than 200 runs in one season only twice in his eight seasons in the IPL. His IPL average of 22 is considerably low than his career T20 average. Despite Maxwell’s low returns in the eight seasons that he has been a part of the Indian Premier League. Despite his low returns, franchises always seem to show interest in him because of his performances for Australia.Gambhir, who had led Maxwell in the Delhi Capitals briefly in IPL 2018, said had the right-hander been consistent with the bat then he would not have played for so many franchises.Also Read | Will Pant lead DC to their maiden IPL title? Kapil Dev gives fascinating answer\"Had Maxwell done really well in the IPL, he wouldn\\'t have played for so many franchises, to be honest,\" Gambhir said. \"He\\'s played for so many franchises because he\\'s not been consistent at all. We can\\'t keep talking about \\'he hasn\\'t had the freedom\\' for the previous franchises he\\'s played for… when he played for Delhi, he had a lot of freedom. Most of these franchises and coaches - because they think he\\'s an X-factor - they want to try and provide him with the best platform where he can succeed.”Maxwell has played for the Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals (Delhi Daredevils before) and Punjab Kings (KXIP before) in the IPL. He was bought for a whopping ₹14.25 crores by RCB in the auctions held earlier this year.\"The only reason why a franchise releases you is because you haven\\'t performed. The more franchises you play for, it just shows you haven\\'t really been able to get settled in any of the franchises. Hopefully, he delivers this time around because every year, he keeps getting more and more money just because he does really well for Australia. So hopefully from RCB\\'s point of view, he can do really well. He\\'s probably got freedom more than any other player in the IPL. I feel he has been very disappointing throughout the IPL, but hopefully, this time around he can turn it,\" Gambhir said.

For the fifth time in a row, the policy rates have been kept unchanged.The monetary policy committee has unanimously voted for the accommodative stance to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward\", the governor said, adding that the focus of the domestic economy should to containing the spread of the virus and economic revival.2021 has seen a bumper food grain production, which will see a softening of the cereal prices, the MPC noted. \"The recent surge in infections has, however, imparted greater uncertainty to the outlook and needs to be closely watched especially as localised lockdowns could dampen the improvements in the demand conditions and delay the return of normalcy,\" the Governor said.Economic activities are normalising, rural demands remain buoyant, urban demand has gained traction, the monetary policy committee has noted, Das said. \"Consumer confidence has dipped with the recent surge in COVID infections in some states imparting uncertainty to the outlook.

              " ' Manipur probe almost over, allow SIT officers to do other work: CBI to SC  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has urged the Supreme Court to allow its officers investigating the alleged extra-judicial killings in Manipur as part of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to do other work as agency’s probe in the encounters is almost wrapped up. The agency has informed the apex court that out of 39 cases registered to investigate alleged fake encounters in Manipur, charge sheets have been filed in 17 cases; 15 cases have been closed while prosecution sanction against army officers or Assam Rifles personnel is awaited in the rest of the cases. An officer, who didn’t want to be named, said the defence ministry has denied prosecution sanction in certain cases citing AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) in Manipur, which gives sweeping powers to the security forces in a ‘disturbed area’. Also Read | CBI registers preliminary enquiry against Anil Deshmukh on HC orderThe Supreme Court, which was hearing a plea seeking a probe into 1,528 cases of alleged extra-judicial killings in Manipur, had on July 14, 2017, ordered constitution of an SIT, which it said will exclusively probe the encounters. The CBI initially formed a five-member SIT, in which two officers of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) – including senior superintendent of police Mahesh Bhardwaj – were later included as members. The SC released Bhardwaj from SIT last month. In its application filed in the apex court on January 7 this year, reviewed by HT, CBI said the “SIT has investigated these cases with all sincerity, seriousness and full devotion to unearth the truth”. The anti-corruption probe agency added “these cases have been investigated with full objectivity and comprehensively to investigate all allegations of use of excessive force or retaliatory force by uniformed personnel resulting in the death of any person”. Requesting the SC to allow its officers to do other work in the agency, it said, “In view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation and ever-increasing workload of CBI, the already over-stretched resources of CBI are to be used optimally”. Expressing its helplessness in taking all the cases to conclusion, CBI said these cases are “years/decades old and are of special nature to the extent that these cannot be investigated only on the basis of documents.” “Circumstantial evidence, oral testimony of the eyewitness (if any) and other relevant witnesses, opinion of medico-legal experts, forensic experts and other scientific evidence are very important for proper investigation of such kind of cases,” CBI said. It said Covid-19 induced lockdowns and restrictions also affected its work but it is trying to complete the investigation at the earliest. The agency further said that SIT’s superintendent of police LS Padmakumar and deputy SP VPS Mann were superannuated in May 2019 and June 2020 respectively while inspector Amar Saxena has passed away.

              " ' Lone Lok Janshakti Party MLA Raj Kumar Singh joins JD(U) in Bihar  In another setback to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), its only member of legislative assembly in Bihar, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the Janata Dal United JD(U) on Tuesday in presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Earlier in February, the party’s only member of legislative council (MLC), Nutan Singh joined the BJP. Now, the LJP has no representation left in the state legislature. Raj Kumar Singh, an MLA from Matihani constituency in Begusarai district, was served a show cause notice by the LJP last month for voting in favour of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate for the post of deputy Speaker. The switch comes in the backdrop of the assembly campaign in the run up to November 2020 assembly elections, which saw the LJP continuously target the JD(U) and chief minister Nitish Kumar, while being friendly to the BJP, which was in alliance with the JD(U) in the state. Though the LJP only won a single seat, the party’s 143 candidates badly hurt JD(U) candidates’ prospects on many seats, analysts say. Chirag Paswan-led LJP has seen heavy defection with over 200 party leaders and office bearers joining the JD(U) recently. Singh first sparked speculations of jumping the ship to the JD(U), following his meeting with the chief minister and a state minister last month.The LJP was founded in the year 2000 by former Union minister and Dalit icon Ram Vilas Paswan, who died on October 8, 2020 ahead of assembly elections in Bihar. Under senior Paswan, the party won 29 assembly seats in the 2005 Bihar assembly polls and emerged as a major force in the state. However, it saw a continuous decline ever since as its number of MLAs came down to 10 a few months later in 2006, when elections were held again in the state. In 2010 elections, the party could only win 3 seats. Later, in 2014 general elections, it won 6 of the 7 Lok Sabha seats it contested in alliance with the BJP. However, in assembly elections held a year later, it could only win two seats. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

According to BMC's April 6 data (which has details till April 5), there are 73 active containment zones in the city, which includes slums and chawls, while 740 buildings remain sealed. The number of containment zones in the city is likely to go up as the civic body has decided to create micro containment zones consisting of one housing society having more than five active Covid-19 cases.The KW ward has the 196 actively sealed buildings, the highest in the city, followed by the D ward which has 116 sealed buildings.According to the new rules in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic, police personnel will be deployed at the entry gate of sealed buildings and no visitors will be allowed at the society which has more than five active Covid-19 cases. The housing societies will have to put up a board outside their gates informing visitors about the Covid-19 cases in their premises.Delivery of essential items will also not be allowed to flats falling in such micro-containment zones. Delivery will have to be made at housing society offices. To go out of the housing premises, for emergency, individuals of such micro-containment zones will need the permission of the society authorities and the police deployed at the gate.On Tuesday, Mumbai recorded 10,040 new cases. Maharashtra, on the other hand, reported 55,469 fresh Covid-19 cases. The second wave of the pandemic has proved to be more intense that the first one in Maharashtra and Mumbai as unprecedented rise has been recorded in the last one month.(With agency inputs) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics mumbai coronavirus covid-19 \",\n",

              " ' Japanese internment art auction stopped after protest  The auction of a series of sketches purportedly drawn by an artist at the Japanese internment camp at Manzanar was canceled Tuesday after groups protested it was offensive and immoral to profit off the misery of incarcerated people.The auction was halted by eBay hours before it was to conclude after company executives met with Japanese American groups who called the sale “hurtful, and a degrading reminder of the mass roundup and incarceration.”“It’s seems unethical and immoral to put this artwork up on eBay to the highest bidder,\" said Shirley Higuchi, author of “Setsuko’s Secret: Heart Mountain and the Legacy of the Japanese American Incarceration.” “When you sell artwork created during an oppressive time for money ... that\\'s against what our society feels is moral.”The groups were led by the Japanese American National Museum and Japanese American Citizens League, which also led a successful effort in 2015 to block the auction of a much larger collection of items of internment art in New Jersey. In that case, hundreds of pieces were turned over to museums that commemorate the US internment of more than 110,000 people of Japanese descent for more than three years on the dubious claim they might betray America in the war.The artwork for sale on eBay were 20 pencil sketches from 1942-43 with the name Matsumura written at the bottom, along with the word Manzanar. The drawings depict mostly what appear to be Japanese landscapes, including one of Mount Fuji.The groups suggested the artist could be Giichi Matsumura, the subject of a series of stories first reported by The Associated Press about a Manzanar incarceree who died in a storm while sketching and painting in the high Sierra in the final days of the war. Several Matsumura families were held at the camp 180 miles (290 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.Lori Matsumura, the granddaughter of Giichi who recently reburied her grandfather\\'s remains after a hiker unearthed his skeleton in 2019, thought the sketches could be by her late father, Masaru, or another family member. The name printed in block letters was similar to the way her father signed high school reports.She had discovered the auction Monday, day six of the weeklong bidding, and entered an $82 bid to try to buy the works. The price had climbed to over $470 when the sale was yanked by eBay.The online auction site removed the sale because it violated an artifacts policy prohibiting the sale of items from government or protected land, spokeswoman Parmita Choudhury said in an email.Matsumura had a mixed reaction to sale being halted.“I feel I may never see those sketches again,” she said. “It depends how the seller reacts.”Higuchi said eBay would contact the seller and put one of the groups in touch to try to obtain the collection.The seller, listed as sunsetderby in Sharon Springs, New York, said the works came from a former girlfriend in the 1980s. The seller would not name the girlfriend in a follow-up message and said the full name of the artist was unknown.The seller said they weren\\'t violating eBay\\'s policies and said other major auction houses had sold similar art.“It’s absolutely preposterous to think that I am doing anything wrong,” the person wrote in response to a question sent through eBay.But Nancy Ukai, project director at 50Objects.org, said sale would cause harm by putting a dollar sign on items that come from the trauma and suffering of what she said was essentially a hate crime against Japanese Americans.People of Japanese descent were forced to burn letters and books before being bused to camps and often abandoned artwork and other items when they returned home.“To put on a platform to the highest bidder is like a ransom to reclaim your history,” she said.In a letter to eBay, the groups cited the current wave of attacks on Asian Americans in the US that have escalated recently.“Sales of our history are never a good thing but are especially hurtful now, when we hear cries to ‘go back to your country,’ exactly what we were told during World War II,” they wrote.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' Goa Speaker to decide on disqualification of 10 MLAs who joined BJP on April 20  Speaker of the Goa assembly, Rajesh Patnekar, told the Supreme Court of India that his final order in the disqualification petitions, filed by the Congress party against 10 Goa BJP MLAs, will be passed by April 20. The SC bench headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had earlier twice rejected the dates proposed by the speaker. When the hearing began, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta told the court that the speaker’s final orders will be delivered on April 29, however, the bench said such a late date was “not acceptable”. “The court again asked the SG to check with the speaker whether he is able to pass the order within a weeks’ time. The SG said the speaker can do it by April 22,” said advocate Abhijit Gosavi, who represented the Congress party. However, the court asked the SG to once again seek instructions from the Speaker whether orders could be passed latest by April 20, following which, Mehta informed the court that the order will be passed on April 20th. SC has set April 21 as the next date of hearing in the case and the judgement is expected before April 22, when the CJI retires. The SC is hearing a plea by Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar seeking directions to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly to expeditiously hear the disqualification petitions filed against 10 MLAs, who switched from the Congress to the BJP in July 2019, reducing the party’s strength in the house to five. The party claims the switch amounted to a defection under the 10th schedule of the Constitution as there was no merger of the original party.As per the anti-defection law, two-thirds of the strength of a legislative party is allowed to merge with another without inviting disqualification. The law, amended in January 2004, does not recognise a split in a legislature party.The then Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Goa assembly, Congress’s Chandrakant Kavlekar joined the BJP on July 10 along with nine other MLAs--Atanasio Monserrate, Jennifer Monserrate, Filipe Neri Rodrigues, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Francisco Silveira, Clafasio Dias, Isidore Fernandes, Wilfred D’Sa and Tony Fernandes. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, said the 10 MLAs had merged with the BJP, increasing the strength of the party to 27 in the state assembly. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Anti-land acquisition movements in these two constituencies had paved the way for Mamata Banerjees’s political resurrection almost 14 years ago.While the BJP has fielded TMC turncoat and incumbent MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya from Singur, the ruling TMC has brought in Becharam Manna, one of its MLAs of an adjacent constituency in the district, to contest from the seat.Click here for full coverage of West Bengal assembly electionsThe BJP had to face initial hiccups as protests broke out after the party fielded a newcomer from the seat. Bhattacharya had joined the BJP in March after the TMC denied him a ticket.Meanwhile, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee would hold four public meetings, two each in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district and South 24 Parganas on Wednesday.BJP’s star campaigners, including Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, and Bollywood actor Mithun Chakraborty, would also hold rallies and roadshows across the state.Veteran actor and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan would also participate in three roadshows in Hooghly to bolster the ruling TMC’s campaign ahead of the fourth phase polls.

              " \" 'Being world No. 1 does not mean you can score 40-ball tons every time': Malan  At 33, Dawid Malan will be a late debutant at the Indian Premier League (IPL). Yet, his giant reputation in the shortest format of the game--he is, after all, the ICC's number one ranked T20 batsman in the world--means the expectations are high from Punjab Kings’ latest recruit.He has achieved a mind boggling T20I average of 50.15 and a strike-rate of 144.31 since making his international debut four years ago. Malan's true ambition lies elsewhere--he wants to be a mainstay in Tests.In this interview, Malan speaks about juggling his Test ambitions with his T20 prowess, the learnings that he will take from the IPL to the T20 World Cup and his game plan for the league.Also Read | Will Pant lead DC to their maiden IPL title? Kapil Dev gives fascinating answerYou have been the No. 1 T20I batsman for quite some time now. What took you so long to play in the IPL?First and foremost you have to be good enough to be picked in this tournament. When you don’t play regular international tournaments, it’s tough to break in especially with not a lot of English head coaches in the IPL. That’s why you see a lot of Australians play in general, because there are so many Australian coaches.Secondly, my primary aim has been to play Test cricket for England and keep doing that. But playing Test cricket for England means you don’t put your name in the IPL because you have to play the first six to eight four-day games of the year which is at the same time as the IPL. That played a massive factor.You said your primary focus is playing Tests. Batsmen are increasingly straddling formats better...you've got lots of players going straight from T20 to TestsThe times are changing but if you look at the best T20 players in the world, you see the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Chris Gayle. They have all played close to 100 Test matches. They have all mastered the basic fundamentals by playing the longer format of the game for an extended period of time.I think sometimes the young kids who are watching or playing too much of white ball cricket do not have the basics right; if things don’t go their way they don’t have anything to fall back on. Test cricket is the fundamental (form). The mindset has changed now. Obviously there is more glamour, more finance, less time away from home, less time on the feet. You can see that trend. If you don’t have the fundamentals right, you have nothing to fall back on if you fail in T20 cricket.How do you plan to handle the huge expectations around you?The criticism and expectation are part of the game. We are all humans. There will be days when you will play like you haven’t picked the bat ever, and then there will be days when you hit everything out of the park. You have to block out the noise. You should play like you want to and not how people expect you to play.Also Read | No place for DC's costliest buys of IPL 2021 in Chopra's ideal Delhi Capitals XIPeople may think you are world No. 1, you can score a century off 40 balls every time you bat, which is not the way the game works. People who criticise don’t really realise T20 cricket is not only about putting your foot down and slogging the ball. There are partnerships, there are ways of building the innings. You have to put your ego aside and play for the team.What will be your batting position in the IPL? No. 3 like you do for England?People often forget that the only time I don’t open the innings is when I play for England. The No. 3 spot was the only spot that was available. I have opened in domestic competitions too. Gradually I have found myself batting at No. 4 and even 5 for England. Not that I prefer to bat there but I am happy to bat at whichever position the team needs me to bat at.How important is the IPL with the T20 World Cup in India in a few months?All the English players who are here realise that this will be an important learning curve. Eoin Morgan spoke about that before we departed for the series against India. We have players who have not played much cricket in India, though they have played in other countries. It (IPL) gives you the opportunity to work with the Indian legends, to improve on certain things, to pick up a few things if you do manage to find a place in the squad for the World Cup. It showed in the way the Indian guys who played in IPL and then made their debut against us. That’s the same for us whether we are 34 or 35, you should be open to learning. Any opportunity to play in these conditions will keep us in good stead at the World Cup.Any particular Indian player who caught your attention in the last series?I really enjoyed watching SKY (Suryakumar Yadav) bat. The way he came out in the T20s. And the other leftie Ishan Kishan. Their ball striking ability was phenomenal, they came out without any fear. Didn’t enjoy them scoring that many runs against us and winning the games. They are examples of how big IPL is in the development of the players. You get to play bowlers like Jofra Archer regularly.

              " \" Indonesia readies hospital ships for cyclone survivors  Indonesia's navy readied hospital ships Wednesday to help treat injured survivors of a cyclone that has killed over 150 in the archipelago and neighbouring East Timor, the disaster agency said.Helicopters were also dropping food and other essentials into remote villages, as rescuers turned to sniffer dogs in the hunt for dozens still missing after weekend floods and landslides devastated the Southeast Asian nations.Torrential rains from Tropical Cyclone Seroja, one of the most destructive storms to hit the region in years, turned small communities into wastelands of mud, uprooted trees and sent around 10,000 people fleeing to shelters.The storm swept buildings in some villages down a mountainside and to the shore of the ocean on Indonesia's Lembata island, where several small communities have been wiped off the map.Indonesia's disaster agency said sniffer dogs would hunt through mountains of debris and rubble in the hopes of finding the bodies of some 76 still-missing victims -- and any survivors.About 120 people have been listed as dead in a remote cluster of islands at the eastern end of the archipelago.Another 34 people have been listed as killed in East Timor -- a tiny half-island nation of 1.3 million sandwiched between Indonesia and Australia that is officially known as Timor-Leste.Its capital Dili was inundated, with the front of its presidential palace transformed into a mud pit.The hospital ships were due to leave Jakarta and Semarang, a city east of Indonesia's capital, bound for the disaster-struck region, said Raditya Jati, spokesman for the disaster agency.Rescuers have spent the past few days using diggers and shovels to extract mud-covered corpses from the debris.Hospitals, bridges and thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm, which flattened scores of small villages.Authorities in both countries were also battling to avoid a spread of Covid-19 in crammed evacuation shelters.East Timor quickly shut its borders last year to avoid a widespread outbreak that threatened to overwhelm its creaky health care system.Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season.January saw floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.And last September, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo.The disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians -- nearly half of the country's population -- live in areas at risk of landslides.The disasters are often caused by deforestation, according to environmentalists.

              " \" Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah director reacts to fan’s request for new Dayaben  Malav Rajda, director of the long-running comedy series Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, had a rather hilarious response to a fan’s request to cast a new actor as Dayaben. The role was played by Disha Vakani but she has been on an indefinite maternity leave since 2017.On one of Malav’s Instagram posts, a fan of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah commented, “plz new daya ko lay aawo sir. itna wait kr ke bhi koi fayda hoga kay aap hi socho. bichare fans kabse wait kr rahe h daya ke liye (Please bring a new Daya on the show, sir. What is the point of delaying it? Poor fans have been waiting for so long).”Replying to the comment, Malav joked that if he starts making demands, he might get replaced himself. “@shindepooja91 mein zyada bolunga toh naya director le aayenge (if I ask for too much, they will get a new director)...its not in my hands at all...i just direct the show...dont n cant take decisions regarding actors n lot of other things...but jo hota hai ache ke liye hota hai (whatever happens, happens for the best),” he wrote.Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, which premiered in 2008, revolves around the residents of the fictional Gokuldham Co-operative Housing Society and their problems. The show stars Dilip Joshi, Bhavya Gandhi, Amit Bhatt, Sunayana Fozdar, Munmun Dutta and others. Malav Rajda said that he has no say when it comes to the casting of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah. Last year, in a podcast with Sorabh Pant, Dilip said that the quality of Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah has suffered. He said that when it was a weekly show, the writers got enough time to write each episode, but after it was made a daily show, they are under pressure to deliver.Also see: Sushmita Sen revisits daughter Alisah's heartwarming essay on adoption, praises her 'wisdom and grace'.

              " ' From Suryakumar Yadav to SKY, the tale of a transformation  “I had only one thing on my mind. The harder I work, the more consistent I become. Someday, my opportunity will come.”Those are cliches, delivered in a matter-of-fact tone that completely belies the hard, gritty truth behind them: Suryakumar Yadav has lived those words. He set out with a dream of playing for India 11 years ago, and last month, at the age of 30, that dream finally came true.In the middle, he has gone through it all. Yadav was not a prodigy; he was a powerful player with a major weakness--he did not have shots to offer on the off side.Then there were allegations of dressing room strife, indiscipline, being hauled up by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) once for questioning his exclusion from the state\\'s one-day team (and included only after tendering an apology). The kind of stuff that doesn’t do much good to a man’s career or confidence.Yadav brushed it aside. He trained. He waited.“When I got to know that I would be making my debut I actually went 8-10 years down the line,” Yadav said over the phone. “I was thinking about my debut for Mumbai in 2010, coming into the Mumbai Indians setup in 2011 and getting to learn a lot in those three years. Then in 2014, when I went to another franchise, I got an opportunity to experience that format before playing first-class regularly. Then when I came back to Mumbai Indians in 2018, I thought this is the right time for me. I’m experienced enough. It’s high time I take a step forward and be harsh on myself.”Also Read | Will Pant lead DC to their maiden IPL title? Kapil Dev gives fascinating answerAnd so he did.He signed up for an unforgiving diet to become leaner. Eight years after he had already become a top-level professional, he began to transform his game, strengthen his off-side strokes. He trained at ungodly hours for specific results, asked friends to give throwdowns during the lockdown and even stepped up to the intimidating challenge of opening the batting for Mumbai Indians. This, while averaging over 44 in 77 first-class matches for Mumbai.It yielded spectacular results, reviving a career that was going nowhere special. At KKR, between 2014 and 2017, Yadav aggregated 164, 157, 182 and 105 runs. The next three seasons at Mumbai Indians, Yadav scored 512, 424 and 480. It was impossible to ignore Yadav’s transformation after the 2020 IPL. He finally made his India debut against England last month, blasting a 31-ball 57 in his second T20I, batting at the coveted No 3 position. Next match, he scored 32 off 17. With Virat Kohli revealing his wish to open for India, Yadav knows the No 3 could be his for the T20 World Cup later this year, but he is not willing to overthink. “I’m really flexible,” he said. “My debut game for India, even though I didn’t bat, I was supposed to bat No 6 or 7 with Hardik. In the next game I got to bat at No 3. So I was happy.”One man who worked with Yadav through his transformation was Mumbai Indians head coach Mahela Jayawardene, who first saw the spark that convinced him to promote Yadav up the order.Also Read | Two of India\\'s best, 3 lethal overseas quicks: Top 5 seamers to watch out for in IPL 2021\"We thought that his skill, technique and game awareness probably suited to opening the batting, which he started with us,” Jayawardene said. “And then bat at No 3 and 4 where he can control the innings, especially in the middle overs. I think he has flourished in that role.\"This is where changing some fundamental aspects of his old game became critical.“Initially he was a player who would use the pace and probably play behind the wicket but over the last 2-3 years he has completely changed that,” said Jayawardene. “He can play in front, covering more areas. He has more ammunition to work with. He has become pretty much a very complete player.”Effecting basic technical changes almost 8-9 years into first-class cricket isn’t easy. The muscle memory makes it difficult to unlearn before getting wired to the new way. “Surya was willing to change, he was willing to do the work,” said Jayawardene. “Not all players would want to change like that. They would probably back their instincts and say ‘Oh this is the way I have played so far and I just want to continue’. It’s entirely up to the player.\" “You can’t be a one-dimensional player batting higher up the order,” said Yadav. “You have to bring in that change. You have to, because this is played at such an international level that people pick your strong and weak points very easily.”Yadav was always a sweet timer of the ball; and to compensate for his off-side weakness, he could always fall back on his strengths: cheeky ramp shots, sweeps and scoops.“I didn’t think too much about the outcome. It was just about practising normal drives, normal cuts and slowly it was built into my muscle memory,\" Yadav said. \"I wasn’t too hard on myself. One day I was batting with a blank mind. And I actually did it.”If he took to the acquisition of new skills with an easy mind, for his physical transformation he went the other way.“After 2018, I sat with our trainer Paul Chapman and decided the boxes that needed to be ticked going into the next season. He said ‘If you are batting higher up the order, you need to bat at least 15 overs if you play really well in that game. And you also have to field for 20 overs.’ I had never done that before,” said Yadav. “I only batted for 10-15 balls (at KKR) and fielded for 20 overs. So this was a completely different scenario for me. I had to be prepared for 2019.”Yadav began to challenge his body, fighting his comfort zone.\"I used to train in the evening when it used to be a little cooler. I changed that to two in the afternoon,” said Yadav. Realising the importance of middle overs when spinners operate, Yadav started batting on Mumbai’s red soil turners right in the middle of the day. “I started practising in the afternoon, between 12-3 pm when the pitches are very dry. That helped me a lot in improving my game against spin.”Being hard on himself was redemptive, given Yadav’s pretty topsy-turvy career till 2017. There was an on-field fracas with Mumbai teammate Shardul Thakur in 2014. He lost Mumbai’s captaincy as well. The IPL too wasn’t offering him many chances at that time. But Yadav’s faith in the game wasn’t shaken.Things first started falling in place in 2018 when Yadav started to bat at No 4 for Mumbai Indians. “Then the team management came up to me and asked if I would like to open the innings. I said ‘Yes, 100%’. I took that as a challenge. I came from a different setup, batting at a completely different position. Coming here, batting higher for such a big team, I took it as a challenge which later on became a responsibility. It wasn’t easy when I came into the setup. But Mahela and Sachin sir said ‘you don’t have to do anything different. Do what you have been doing and enjoy your time in the middle’.”“I did exactly that. And never looked back.”If the 2018 IPL was a sign of the changes to come, 2020 was really where Yadav was at the peak of his ability, thriving in the role of a finisher at No 3. He averaged 40 at a strike rate of 145, both career best numbers in the IPL. He also hit 61 boundaries, the most by a Mumbai Indians batsman and 15 more than Quinton de Kock, the next best boundary hitter. Yadav finally knows his game. He knows he can take his time. That\\'s what makes him more menacing in the death overs. “There are power hitters in this team. It makes my job easier. I don’t need to do anything out of the box and fill in their shoes. I just need to be myself.\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics suryakumar yadav ipl 2021 ',\n",
              " ' Amid rising Covid cases, IMF raises India outlook  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday upgraded its FY22 growth projection for India to 12.5% from 11.5% estimated in January, but cautioned that the forecast hasn’t factored in the severe downside risks arising from the country’s ongoing second wave of Covid-19.Briefing reporters while releasing the IMF’s biannual World Economic Outlook, chief economist Gita Gopinath said the one percentage point increase in India’s growth forecast for FY22 came in the background of encouraging signs from high-frequency indicators.“This came with the evidence we were getting in the last couple of months in terms of normalisation of economic activity. These numbers precede the current wave of the virus, which is quite concerning. So, it comes before that,” she added.India registered more than 100,000 Covid cases on Sunday, crossing the peak of the first wave of the pandemic, with almost 50% of the cases being reported from Maharashtra. The state imposed a partial lockdown on Sunday, closing down malls, theatres, hotels, restaurants and imposing a statewide night curfew. On Tuesday, Delhi also declared a night curfew.Malhar Nabar, head of the World Economic Studies division at the IMF, said the second wave poses severe downside risk to the growth outlook.“In the current forecast, we have already taken a fairly conservative view on the sequential growth of the Indian economy for this year. But it’s true that this very worrying uptick in cases pose very severe downside risk to the growth outlook for the economy,” he added.Gopinath said faster progress with vaccinations can raise the growth forecast of both developed and developing countries, while a more prolonged pandemic with virus variants that evade vaccines can lead to a sharp downgrade.“Multi-speed recoveries could pose financial risks if interest rates in the US rise further in unexpected ways. This could cause inflated asset valuations to unwind in a disorderly manner, financial conditions to tighten sharply, and recovery prospects to deteriorate, especially for some highly leveraged emerging markets and developing economies,” she added.The report said in emerging market and developing economies, vaccine procurement data suggest that effective protection will remain unavailable for most of the population in 2021.“Lockdowns and containment measures may be needed more frequently in 2021 and 2022 than in advanced economies, increasing the likelihood of medium-term scarring effects on the potential output of these countries,” it added.She said divergent recovery paths are likely to create wider gaps in living standards across countries compared to pre-pandemic expectations.The IMF has projected the global economy to expand 6% this year, up from the 5.5% pace estimated in January.

              " ' ‘Independent board members have failed’: Sebi chairman  Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi on Tuesday said the market regulator has failed to ensure that independent directors do not act under the influence of company promoters, despite several attempts to make sure the rights of minority shareholders are protected.“I must admit that notwithstanding various efforts, we are yet to get ideal solutions to issues such as ensuring the independence of independent directors, selecting the best-suited persons as independent directors and making their role more effective and meaningful,” said Tyagi at a corporate governance summit organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry.“Yet another issue commonly raised is that howsoever we may strengthen the processes related to independent directors, those who are genuinely not independent will never be. It is true that human behaviour cannot be fully regulated by norms. However, it is our endeavour through improved processes and disclosures to bring in greater balance, transparency and quality in the selection of independent directors and functioning of the corporate boards,” Tyagi said.There are about 6,800 listed firms and Sebi’s listing obligations and disclosure regulations (LODR) require them to adhere to basic corporate governance standards so that no stakeholder is treated inequitably.Sebi’s primary aim to have independent directors in listed firms is to ensure that investments made by millions of small retail shareholders in these entities do no face unfair risks.On March 1, Sebi issued a consultation paper proposing to make the process of appointment and resignation of independent directors transparent.Sebi wants a company to secure dual approval, one from the board and the other from minority shareholders, both for appointments and resignations of independent directors. At present, an independent director is appointed if approved by a majority of shareholders, including the promoter and non-promoters.Sebi has also proposed that if an independent director exits a board, the full resignation letter should be disclosed to the stock exchanges. It has also proposed that instead of profit-linked commissions, independent directors should be remunerated through long-duration stock options.Towards the end of 2018, several independent directors of jailed businessman Rana Kapoor-promoted Yes Bank had quit the bank’s board through a series of resignations. However, the actual letters of resignations were not disclosed to the public by the bank, whose board was eventually taken over by a Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator and subsequently replaced by a new board after State Bank of India picked up a majority stake in the bank to salvage it from becoming a complete failure.Tyagi re-emphasized the need to separate the roles of chairperson and managing director in Indian firms. “The underlying idea for such a separation is not to weaken the position of promoter, but to improve corporate governance. The objective is to provide a better and more balanced governance structure by enabling more effective supervision of the management. Separation of the roles will reduce excessive concentration of authority in a single individual. Having the same person as chairman and managing director brings in a conflict of interest,” he said.

              " ' Adani joins Reliance, Tata with $100 billion market cap  The Adani group became the third Indian conglomerate to surpass $100 billion in market value as a dizzying rally in the shares of Gautam Adani-run companies propelled the group past many titans of Indian industry.On Tuesday, shares of four of the six publicly traded Adani group companies soared to a record. Adani Enterprises Ltd surged 8% to ₹1,240.45; Adani Total Gas Ltd rose 6% to ₹1,248; Adani Transmission Ltd jumped 5% to ₹1,147; and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd soared 14% to ₹852.The group has established a commanding presence in the country’s infrastructure sector, an area that the central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid special emphasis on to stimulate growth. Over the past few years, it has made major investments across airports, data centres, natural gas infrastructure, ports and renewable energy.On Tuesday, the total market value of the six listed Adani Group companies stood at more than $107 billion, according to BSE data. Only two other Indian groups—the Tata group and Mukesh Ambani led-Reliance Industries Ltd—have achieved this milestone. The Tata group’s current market value stands at $242 billion, while Reliance Industries’ market capitalization is at $190 billion.Analysts say the recent surge in stock prices of Adani group was on account of rapid expansion by many group firms that led to earnings visibility in the future. “Adani group stocks have had a strong run over the last year, mainly due to strong traction in renewables and large order wins. However, considering the sharp run-up, the valuations look stretched now. We would thus recommend waiting for a correction before making any fresh investment,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president of research, Religare Broking.A total of five companies in the Adani group currently have a market cap of over ₹1 lakh crore, with only Adani Power Ltd failing to make the cut. Still, the money-losing Adani Power has tripled its market value in the past year to ₹38,000 crore.Adani Total Gas, the group’s city gas distribution venture, saw its market cap jump more than 13-fold in the past year to 1.32 trillion.Throughout the pandemic, the Adani group has aggressively expanded its presence across Indian infrastructure through a mix of organic growth and acquisitions.Group flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd ventured into the airports sector in 2019 and now controls seven airports in India and a quarter of the country’s air traffic. It acquired a controlling stake in the Mumbai International Airport.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd has acquired three big ports with a combined value of ₹18,000 crore over the past six months, including the Krishnapatnam Port Ltd, Gangavaram Port Ltd and Dighi Port.

              " ' Public banks prop up Jan Dhan as pvt lenders falter  India’s state-run banks helped drive the tally of Jan Dhan bank accounts in the year ended March 31, offsetting a weaker performance by private lenders in the government’s flagship financial inclusion programme, data reviewed by Mint showed.Launched in August 2014, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) aims to provide universal access to banking with at least one basic bank account for every household.Private banks counted 55,349 fewer Jan Dhan bank accounts as of end-March, compared to the start of FY21. State-run lenders, meanwhile, continued to power the programme’s reach.As of March 24 — the latest available data — the total number of such basic savings accounts stood at 420.8 million for all banks, up from 380.7 million as of April 1, 2020, showed data from the PMJDY website. This is the aggregate of public sector banks, regional rural banks and private banks.Although on a net basis, Jan Dhan accounts at private banks saw a decline of more than 55,000, some individual private banks recorded steeper contractions. For instance, ICICI Bank Ltd, one of India’s largest private-sector banks, ended the fiscal with 278,522 fewer Jan Dhan bank accounts than in April last year. Others such as Karur Vysya Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, RBL Bank and Yes Bank also saw a similar trend, albeit of varying proportions.“ICICI Bank has the largest number of Jan Dhan accounts among private sector banks. Some accounts, which were inoperative for a few years, were closed last year. Since they were dormant accounts, their closure did not cause inconvenience to customers,” an ICICI Bank spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The other banks cited above did not respond to emailed queries.In stark contrast to their private peers, accounts at state-owned lenders grew 29 million between April 1, 2020, and March 24, 2021.A senior public sector banker in charge of financial inclusion said that while there used to be several inoperative Jan Dhan accounts earlier, the situation has changed post-covid.“With the Centre crediting accounts with funds under various covid-19 schemes, the trend has reversed. While some accounts could have been closed because of inactivity, that is not the sole reason,” the banker said.As of January 15, 2020, 18.7% of Jan Dhan accounts were inoperative, data presented in the Parliament showed. A bank account turns inoperative if there are no transactions for two years. Bankers and sector experts said some banks may have closed some such accounts after finding duplication in some of them. According to guidelines, a customer cannot have multiple basic accounts in different banks. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The first confirmed infection was reported on Monday. It was found in a patient tested by Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory in California, according to news reports. The case was detected in the San Francisco Bay Area, as reported by The Hill.The new strain of the coronavirus is called “double mutant” because it carries two mutations of the pathogen.It has hit the US amid growing concerns about an impending surge fuelled by new variations and complacency following reports of high vaccination rates.“This Indian variant contains two mutations in the same virus for the first time, previously seen on separate variants,” Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at University of California San Francisco, told San Francisco Chronicle.A response was awaited from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to a request for confirmation of news reports about the new variant.EMA has ‘not yet reached conclusion’ on AZ vaccineThe EU’s drug regulator said on Tuesday it is still deciding whether the AstraZeneca vaccine causes blood clots, after a top official said there was a clear link. The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) safety committee “has not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing”, the Amsterdam-based EMA said in a statement. “We will communicate and hold a press briefing as soon as the review is finalised.”The statement came after the EMA’s head of vaccine strategy, Marco Cavaleri, was quoted in the media as saying there was a “clear” connection and the agency would announce it.US President Joe Biden was set to announce on Tuesday that all adults in America will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccines by April 19, two weeks earlier than his previous goal, a White House official said.

              " ' World Health Day: Address inequities to build a healthier world, says WHO  At a high-level virtual event on World Health Day on Wednesday, the health ministers of countries in south-east Asia, including India, will commit to “building a fairer and healthier world”, the theme for this year’s event.The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked the countries in the south-east Asia region to prioritise actions to address inequities compounded by the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“Covid-19 is just the latest disease to expose, exploit and exacerbate inequities that negatively impact health and socioeconomic outcomes between and among vulnerable groups. Understanding and overcoming the many social and economic determinants of health is becoming critical in our efforts to achieve universal health coverage,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO south-east Asia.World Health Day is celebrated every year on April 7, with a different theme.Also Read | Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru: These cities are under curbs as Covid-19 cases riseThe United Nations health body stressed the need for collecting quality data to be able to take timely action.“We must enhance the collection and use of timely and reliable health data that is disaggregated by gender, age, income, education, migratory status and disability among other factors,” said Khetrapal Singh.India on Monday launched Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP), the revised next generation Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) that is totally digital, in line with Union health ministry’s National Digital Health Mission.Instead of manually collecting data on infectious diseases, the new platform will upload and collate data digitally that will help pick up any clustering in realtime, and in turn avert a potential outbreak in the country. Also, the number of diseases to be covered as part of the country’s disease surveillance programme has been extended to 33, from the existing 18.Another key measure suggested by WHO is for the countries to strengthen their primary health care delivery system.“The launch of health and wellness centres under the government’s Ayushman Bharat Yojana will serve the exact same purpose, to be able to deliver primary health care at the grassroots level; making healthcare accessible even in hard-to-reach areas,” said a senior government official. The UN body also suggested that there was a need for countries to act beyond national borders, and strengthen regional and global health security.“As a new wave of infection is spreading across the region, there is a need for countries to come together, and strengthen the basic public health measures that are known to work, while also accelerating vaccine rollouts. Nearly 86 million people in the region have now received their first dose and more than 14 million have received both doses,” said Khetrapal Singh.“...The region continues to make rapid and sustained progress against diseases of poverty and marginalisation... All people have the right to achieve the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. A fairer and healthier region and world is possible,” she added. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Astronomers trace rare blast to Wolf-Rayet stars  Indian astronomers have tracked a rare supernova explosion and traced it to one of the hottest kinds of stars called ‘Wolf-Rayet’ or WR stars. Supernovae (SNe) are highly energetic explosions in the universe releasing an enormous amount of energy.Long-term monitoring of these transients opens the door to understand the nature of the exploding star as well as the explosion properties. It can also help enumerate the number of massive stars, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said in a statement.The rare Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects, a thousand times more than the Sun and have intrigued astronomers for long. They are massive stars and strip their outer hydrogen envelope which is associated with the fusion of Helium and other elements in the massive core.A team of astronomers from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, along with international collaborators have conducted optical monitoring of one such stripped-envelope supernova called SN 2015dj hosted in the galaxy NGC 7371 which was spotted in 2015, it said. They calculated the mass of the star that collapsed to form the supernovae as well as the geometry of its ejection.This work was recently published in The Astrophysical Journal.The scientists also found that the original star was a combination of two stars, one of them is a massive WR star and another much less in mass than the sun, the statement added.

              " \" Will Pant lead DC to their maiden IPL title? Kapil Dev gives fascinating answer  Rishabh Pant continues to be one of the biggest talking points in the lead-up to IPL 2021. The chatter around Pant went up by several notches when the swashbuckling left-hander was named as the Delhi Capitals captain for this season in place of Shreyas Iyer, who was ruled out with a shoulder injury. India’s first-ever World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has now shared his thoughts on what he expects from Pant the captain in the 14th edition of the Indian Premier League, starting from April 9.Kapil was asked whether Pant can lead Delhi Capitals to their maiden IPL title in his first stint as captain in the cash-rich league. The former India all-rounder agreed the chances are slim but gave a fascinating explanation behind his thoughts about Pant’s captaincy.“Yes, there maybe 25-26% chances (of Pant winning the IPL for DC), I don't think anything more than that because then you're saying he's better than the other teams (captains). He's a new captain, he needs a lot of experience. But it's a bit difficult to go all the way (in his first attempt as captain),” Kapil told ABP News.Also Read | No place for DC's costliest buys of IPL 2021 in Chopra's ideal Delhi Capitals XIPant, who has played only for Delhi Capitals in the IPL ever since he was bought by the franchise in 2016, has been in fantastic form for India in all three formats after regaining his place in the side in the second Test in Australia.Also watch: Mumbai Indians' Jasprit Bumrah sweats it out in quarantine, shares video \\ufeffPant has led Delhi in Ranji Trophy before but Kapil believes this will be a different situation altogether.“He has become the captain, what can be more secure than that. But with captaincy comes responsibility, as well. It will not be easy for Pant. I wanted him to continue his fearless game but if management thinks that he can do better as a captain in near future then why not. We'll have to wait for the result of this responsibility in this season.Also Read | Two of India's best, 3 lethal overseas quicks: Top 5 seamers to watch out for in IPL 2021“We should focus on how he handles the team. It's not an easy task with so many senior players. A small section of people can blame him if DC don't perform. As the time passes, I hope he comes out with flying colours,” Kapil added.That DC picked Pant ahead of proven IPL captains Steve Smith, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin and Shikhar Dhawan, speaks volumes about their faith in the wicketkeeper-batsman but Kapil believes the young left-hander will need all the support from the seniors to perform well as a leader.“If senior players support him then it won't be that difficult for him. I had a similar experience of becoming a Captain at such a young age.“Ricky Ponting can control the game only in the dressing room. Once the team is out on the ground, it's the captain's thought process that matters more. And experienced players like Rahane and Dhawan Will have to support the young captain. Sometimes the support is missing and we have to wait for the first few matches to get there,” Kapil said. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ABP News (@abpnewstv) Pant, who has scored 2079 runs for DC in 68 matches at an impressive average of 35.23 and a superb strike rate of 151.97 will look to carry his international form in the T20 league.Kapil said the left-hander’s performance will be the most crucial aspect this year.“The most important factor will be his own performance. If he performs well then he'll gradually get everyone's support but if his performance is not up to the mark the everyone will say it was because of captaincy pressure. He is going into the tournament after playing some very good cricket,” he said.Further explaining his thoughts about Pant’s captaincy, Kapil said it will be a learning curve for the left-hander.“I can't say now whether Rishabh Pant is a good captain material or not, it's very difficult. It can be decided only once he gets his hands on it. And at this stage, it's very difficult because the pressure is at another level. If he performs well, it will be a great thing for the team,” he said.Delhi Capitals will begin their IPL 2021 journey against Chennai Super Kings on April 10.

The situation turned so violent that the police had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the agitating students. Vice-Chancellor of the varsity, Sanjiv Mittal said, \"At around 12 noon, we heard a high intensity sound, as if a bomb has exploded outside the administrative building. \"When we went outside to see what had happened, we saw that some youths were ransacking the administrative building. They wanted to meet the vice-chancellor. \"When I talked to them, they handed me a memorandum and said that they wanted the examination to be held in online mode. I told them that we could discuss it in the office. But they refused to cooperate and continued ransacking. \"Subsequently, we informed the police. When police chased them away, they went on vandalising whatever came on their way while escaping. We have also lodged a complaint with the police in this regard,\" the VC said. The irate students broke air coolers, table, chairs, reception desk, and window glasses besides many other things of the administrative building. A teacher of the varsity, Biswajit Satpathy also sustained injuries in the incident. Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), Burla, S.

              " ' Delhi Covid cases cross 5,000-mark for first time since November 27  The Covid graph in the city continued its steep upward climb on Tuesday, with the number of daily cases breaching 5,000-mark — first time since November-end. The city on Tuesday recorded 5,100 new cases and 17 deaths due to the viral infection, even as it set a new record for daily tests.The increase in cases has been sharper during the “fourth wave” – as the Delhi government refers to the current surge, with the numbers rising from under 1,000 to over 5,000 in just 15 days..Experts, however, say this is the second spike that the city is witnessing.Despite the high number of cases, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – remained below 5% due to the high number of tests conducted. The city reported a positivity rate of 4.93% on Tuesday, with 103,453 test having been conducted the previous day, as per the health bulletin. Tuesday was the first time the city has seen over 100,000 tests in a day.“The number of cases has definitely gone up faster this time around. This is because many people who are positive are moving around and restaurants and gyms are open. Normally, there is a surge in cases within 60 to 100 days of easing of restrictions. This is the natural behaviour of the virus. And, this is likely to continue till April or maybe May,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. He headed Delhi government’s first committee on control and management of Covid-19 cases.He added that the number of cases this time might even cross the record of daily cases set during the “third” peak of November. On November 11, Delhi had reported 8,593 cases, the highest till date for the city.In addition to the night curfew, Sarin said that studies have shown that the restaurants should only offer outdoor seating or give takeaways.“Restaurants and bars lead to the spread of the infection; you have to remove your mask if you have to eat or drink. An interesting study from the Columbia district in Washington DC showed that when restaurants were opened up after following strict masking norms, the number of cases increased 10-fold and number of deaths five-fold in 100 days,” he said.The experts said that asymptomatic transmission was a major cause of concern during the current surge. “It has now been established that nearly 60% of the transmission can happen from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Targeting only those with symptoms, such as fever, is not good enough. We need to trace more contacts and quarantine them,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.He added, “The pool of people transmitting silently will only increase as more and more people get vaccinated. This is because those who receive even one shot of the vaccine get some amount of immunity and are likely to have milder symptoms. They are also likely to not get tested and hence transmit it on to others.”Dr Sarin agreed, adding, “The antibodies which form after an infection or immunisation are almost same. And, over 50% of Delhi’s population is seropositive. They are moving around and if they get the infection, and they can, they will have mild symptoms and may pass on the infection to others.”Both experts said that there is a need to increase vaccinations. With the Centre opening up vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years, Delhi’s drive has also picked up pace. A record 87,678 doses were administered on Monday, of which 73% were given at government facilities, said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.As per provisional reports, 74,642 doses were administered on Tuesday. This comes a day after the government announced that at least one-third of the vaccination centres in 33 Delhi government hospitals will run 24x7 Tuesday onwards.“Around 95% of the total slots in government centres were utilised as compared to 67% in private hospitals. The trend was the opposite initially when the vaccination drive had begun. However, people are now happy with the facilities in government centres and are coming there,” said Jain. So far, 1.38 million persons in Delhi have been administered at least one shot of the vaccine.Meanwhile, the cases increase, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has stopped walk-in registrations at its out-patient clinics which had been restarted in December. “To optimise diversion of available manpower and material resources … Covid-19 disease, it has been decided to temporarily close down routine walk-in OPD,” read an order from the medical superintendent of the hospital.

A Twitter user replied, “Even I didn't understand Aladin.”Taking the comment in good humour, Sujoy joked about the poor box office collection of Aladin. “Lies. i have a list of all the 31 people who saw aladin. your name is not in the list. i’ll add?” was his funny response. finally saw tenet. did not understand anything.— sujoy ghosh (@sujoy_g) April 6, 2021 lies. i have a list of all the 31 people who saw aladin. your name is not in the list. i’ll add? https://t.co/euxdv1mrLM— sujoy ghosh (@sujoy_g) April 6, 2021 Sujoy’s response drew appreciation from fans. “Respect dada.

              " ' Italy to allow fans at Euros, some other hosts yet to decide  Italy is ready to let fans back into stadiums in time for Rome hosting European Championship games. Other countries are yet to offer the same assurances.The pandemic-delayed tournament is being staged in 12 cities in as many countries, and UEFA told hosts to let them know by this week about its plans to let supporters into games.Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza informed the country\\'s football federation on Tuesday that fans can attend the four matches in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico based on protocols from scientific advisors.“The willingness obtained from the Italian government is an excellent result that is good for the country, not just football,” FIGC President Gabriele Gravina said.There is a risk that cities could be cut from the hosting if they can\\'t say if crowds will be allowed by June. Those guarantees are yet to come from countries including Scotland, which is due to stage four games in Glasgow, and Ireland, which also has four fixtures in Dublin.While parts of Europe are in the midst of a third wave of coronavirus infections, the city of Munich says it has now submitted updated plans to UEFA.“It is of course conceivable and desirable that spectators can be in the stadium for the four games in Munich,\" local authorities said Tuesday.Italy will play Turkey in Rome on June 11 in the first match of the competition, which was postponed by one year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Italy will also play its other two matches at the Olimpico, which will also host a quarterfinal.Fans have been banned from matches in Italy for the majority of the past year, apart from a brief period shortly after the start of the season when up to 1,000 spectators were allowed into stadiums.“A strong signal has been sent to us heading towards recovery and we will promptly pass it on to UEFA,\" Gravina said.The city with the most games is London, which will stage seven fixtures at Wembley including the semifinals and final. Wembley will see the return of fans this month for the first time in more than a year when 4,000 spectators are allowed into an FA Cup semifinal and 8,000 will be permitted at the League Cup final. The FA Cup final will then have a crowd of 21,000 in May thanks to England\\'s success in rolling out a vaccination program and bringing down coronavirus cases.“This is an important first step towards getting fans back, with the end goal of full stadia — hopefully by the end of the men’s Euros,\" English Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham said.In Scotland, no date has been set for the return of fans but provisional proposals will be submitted to UEFA this week. Scotland will host the Czech Republic and Croatia at Hampden Park after its men qualified for a first major tournament since the 1998 World Cup.“We are well aware of the deadline and while these are not final decisions for us, I am optimistic we will have matches played here in Scotland with a number of spectators, a reasonably good number of spectators in Hampden for them,\" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. “But obviously these are discussions and deliberations and decisions that have to be made by the appropriate authorities.”Russia has already confirmed that St. Petersburg’s 65,000-seat stadium will be filled to at least 50% capacity for its four games. Denmark is planning on up to 12,000 fans being allowed into the four matches at the 38,000-capacity Parken Stadium. A similar number could be attending games in Romania under government plans for the 55,000-capacity national stadium in Bucharest to be at least a quarter filled.UEFA also remains hopeful of retaining Baku (Azerbaijan), Budapest (Hungary) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) as host cities with fans allowed.

              " ' IPL 2021 - Two of India\\'s best, 3 lethal overseas quicks: Top 5 seamers to watch  It\\'s that time of the year again! The Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) is back and this time, just less than six months after the previous season.While batsmen tend to dominate the T20 format and have the potential to play a deciding role in a match\\'s result, bowlers too with pace, spin, variations, and deception have the ability to turn a twenty-over game on its head single-handedly.In IPL 2020, which was played in the UAE due to the coronavirus pandemic, the pacers topped the bowling charts. Kagiso Rabada (30) and Anrich Nortje (22), from runners-up Delhi Capitals, finished first and fourth in the tally, respectively. Jasprit Bumrah (27) and Trent Boult (25), from the championship-winning side Mumbai Indians, finished second and third respectively.Also Read | No place for DC\\'s costliest buys of IPL 2021 in Chopra\\'s ideal Delhi Capitals XIIPL is back to India and with matches slated to take place at six venues--Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and New Delhi--- expect the spinners to have a bigger say but the pacers continue to hold the aces.Also watch | IPL 2021: Will Covid surge affect tournament? BCCI vice-president answers \\ufeffBefore the action begins, let\\'s take a look at top bowlers to watch out for:1) Jasprit Bumrah Mumbai Indians (MI) player Jasprit Bumrah appeals(PTI) The leader of Mumbai\\'s bowling pack is Jasprit Bumrah. The right-arm pacer has finished as the defending champions\\' highest-wicket taker for the last two seasons with 19 and 27 wickets, respectively. In 2017, he finished second in the list with 17 wickets, just one behind Hardik Pandya. Bumrah\\'s pace and movement up front and pin-point accuracy at the death makes him one of the most dangerous bowlers in the league. His companion Trent Boult finished with 25 wickets in 2020, making the duo even more lethal. Mumbai will hope to see Bumrah find his rhythm at the earliest as he will be playing his first game after a month-long break. He didn\\'t feature in the T20I and ODI series against England due to personal reasons. In 92 IPL matches, Bumrah has picked 109 wickets at an economy of 7.41.2) Kagiso Rabada Delhi Capitals player Kagiso Rabada reacts(PTI) Delhi Capitals reaching the final in the UAE in 2020 was largely possible due to Proteas pacer Kagiso Rabada. The speedster bagged 30 wickets and won the Purple Cap. Interestingly Rabada was retained by the Delhi side in 2019 despite not featuring in a single game during the previous season. However, Delhi struck gold with the decision as Rabada went on to take 25 wickets and finish the season as the team\\'s highest wicket-taker. Rabada left the ongoing Pakistan-SA ODI series midway, during which he picked up two wickets in two matches, to join his IPL franchise on time. Twenty-six-year-old Rabada 61 wickets from 35 IPL games. He will once again be the key for the Delhi side in the IPL 2021 as they look to go one better than last year and finally win the elusive trophy.Also Read | ‘You have to bite the bullet’: Ganguly remembers biggest setback of career3) Bhuvneshwar Kumar Sunrisers Hyderabad player Bhuvneshwar Kumar(PTI) He is the kind of figure you need to lead your bowling attack. A calm, composed, and focussed individual who quietly goes about his business-- that is to take wickets--but creates maximum noise and buzz around him. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the Purple Cap winner in the 2016 season with 23 wickets as Sunrisers Hyderabad lifted their first IPL title. A dangerous swing bowler who is often called one of the most skillful white-ball bowlers in the world, Bhuvi, simply put, just a difficult bowler to put away. He may not be the quickest of the lot but he\\'s definitely got enough trick up his sleeves to cause damage towards the end of the innings. He featured in the recently-concluded white-ball leg of the India-England series. He started off slow but began to increase his wicket-tally pretty quickly towards the end and his pristine economy rate only made his team\\'s life easier4) Kyle Jamieson Kyle Jamieson(AP) We are going to talk about three massive talking points of the IPL 2021 auction, who all happen to be pacers, but let\\'s begin with New Zealand Kyle Jamieson. Standing tall at 6\\'8\", the Kiwi speedster entered the auction at a base price of ₹75 lakh but came out with a ₹15 crore contract from the Royal Challengers Bangalore. While he started off his career in Test cricket, Jamieson has also been inducted into the white-ball sides in the last few months. He\\'s played six Tests, five ODIs, and eight T20Is and it is interesting to note he only made his T20I debut months after making his Test debut. In all T20s, the 26-year-old has pocketed 55 wickets in 42 matches and his height and bounce will come in handy for RCB.5) Chris Morris Chris Morris will play for RR this year(PTI) On February 18, 2021, Chris Morris became the most expensive player in the history of the league when he was bought for ₹16.25 at the auction. In 2020, he represented RCB, picking 11 wickets and scoring 34 runs in nine matches. He was bought for ₹10 crore from the Delhi franchise ahead of the 2020 season. The all-rounder is 34 now and it will be important for his workload to be managed properly. He has faced multiple layoffs due to injuries in the past and Rajasthan Royals wouldn\\'t want to see such a player on the sidelines. He is an experienced campaigner in this league, having played 70 matches with 80 in his kitty at an economy rate of 7.81. Now that Jofra Archer has been ruled out of the first half due to a hand injury, the onus will be on Morris to spearhead the pace attack SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics ipl 2021 jasprit bumrah ',\n",
              " ' Malaysia’s former PM Najib served with bankruptcy notice over tax bill  Malaysia’s former prime minister Najib Razak said he was served with a bankruptcy notice by the Inland Revenue Board for failing to pay a tax bill totaling 1.74 billion ringgit ($420 million).He said the “tyrannical” tax imposed on him has no merit and has asked his lawyer to obtain a stay order, according to his Facebook post late Tuesday.The bankruptcy notice came as he began his appeal against his conviction last year on charges in a case involving millions he received from a former unit of troubled state fund 1MDB.

              " \" Facebook removes accounts tied to Iranian exile group  Facebook said Tuesday it has removed hundreds of fake accounts linked to an Iranian exile group and a troll farm in Albania.The accounts posted content critical of Iran's government and supportive of Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, a dissident group known as MEK. In many cases, the Facebook and Instagram accounts used fake profile names and photos.Facebook determined the accounts were being run from a single location in Albania by a group of individuals working on behalf of MEK. Facebook found other telltale clues suggesting a so-called troll farm, in which workers are often paid to post content, including misinformation, to social media. Facebook says it removes such accounts based on how they behave, not on the material they post.For one, researchers found that the activity seemed to follow the central European workday, with posts picking up after 9 a.m., slowing down at the end of the day, and with a noticeable pause at lunch time. Facebook, however, said it did not find evidence of people being paid.“Even trolls need to eat,” said Ben Nimmo, who works on Facebook’s global threat intelligence investigations, on a conference call with reporters Tuesday.The National Council for Resistance in Iran, an umbrella group that includes MEK, said in a statement that that no accounts affiliated with it or MEK have been removed. The group also denied the existence of an Albanian troll farm affiliated with MEK.MEK is a leading group opposing the Iranian government. It killed Americans before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and was labeled as a terrorist organization by the State Department until 2012. Nevertheless, U.S. politicians from both parties including Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich have given paid speeches to MEK in the past.The network of fake accounts was most active in 2017 and again in late 2020, Facebook said. In all, more than 300 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram were removed as part of the company's action. Around 112,000 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.In some cases, the fake accounts used photos of Iranian celebrities or deceased dissidents. A small number of the more recent Instagram accounts appear to have used profile pictures that were computer generated. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics facebook inc. \",\n",
              " \" Millionaires in New York set to face highest tax rates in US  The highest-earning New Yorkers would face the nation's steepest income tax rate under a budget lawmakers expected to vote on and pass Tuesday.It would serve as a win for the Democratic party's left wing, who say that millionaires in Manhattan penthouses have fared far better amid the pandemic then struggling small businesses and low-income New Yorkers.States including California, Minnesota and Washington are also considering wealth taxes, raising taxes on capital gains or setting new top income tax rates. President Joe Biden — who said on the campaign trail he'd raise income taxes on high earners — has proposed tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families and a corporate tax rate increase to pay for his infrastructure plan.Democrats in New York hope the tax increase could bring in at least $2.8 billion this upcoming year and prevent the need for spending cuts in years to come.New York’s top income tax rate is currently 8.82% for income over roughly $1 million, while New York City residents face an additional 3.88% top tax rate.New York is now set to raise the combined top tax rate for New York City millionaires above California’s top income tax rate of 13.3%.New Yorkers who make over $1 million would face a 9.65% income tax rate. That increases to 10.3% for taxpayers who make between $5 million and $25 million, and 10.9% for those who make over $25 million.“Working and middle-class taxpayers will receive the relief they desperately need, while the wealthiest New Yorkers will help their neighbors,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement announcing that legislative leaders and Cuomo reached a budget deal Tuesday.The exact language of the tax hike wasn't available online until late Tuesday evening. New York was also set to raise the corporate tax rate from 6.5% to 7.25% for taxpayers with net incomes over $5 million. That move — along with a reinstatement of the capital base tax — would raise $750 million this upcoming year.Democrats won control of the state Senate in 2018, but they gained more leverage last year by winning a veto-proof supermajority.Cuomo expressed newfound openness to raising taxes on top-earners this year — his budget proposal included a limited, temporary tax increase on high-earners if New Yorkers didn't receive extra COVID-19 aid.He's also long warned that raising taxes on the wealthy could drive them out of New York at a time when the state's economy is still recovering from COVID-19 economic shutdowns last week. His budget director, Robert Mujica, has said the top 1% of earners pay 40% of New York’s income taxes.And Mujica has said an additional $12 billion in expected federal COVID-19 aid could prevent the need for a tax hike.But Democratic legislative leaders who have pushed forward with a proposed tax hike said there's no conclusive evidence that tax hikes drive out the rich. And they criticize years of “fiscal austerity” under Cuomo, as health care costs rise and educational advocacy groups call for more spending on schools.Medicaid costs have skyrocketed as New York has boosted enrollment, raised the minimum wage for all workers and taken on more Medicaid bills once shouldered by counties.

              " ' Children suffering from inflammatory illness had mild Covid, shows new study  Many children with serious inflammatory illness did not display any symptoms of Covid-19 disease and those who did showed only mild symptoms, according to a new US study.According to the results published in the JAMA Pediatrics on Tuesday of the largest US study of the cases of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) in children, which can strike young people weeks after they were infected with Covid-19.Many children and teenagers who developed the mysterious inflammatory syndrome that can emerge several weeks after contracting the coronavirus never had classic Covid-19 symptoms at the time of their infection, says the study.According to the New York Times, the study, led by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that in over 1,000 cases in which information about whether they got sick from their initial Covid-19 illness was available, 75 per cent of the patients did not experience such symptoms.However, two to five weeks later, they became sick enough to be hospitalized for the condition, called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which can affect multiple organs, especially the heart.The study said \"most MIS-C illnesses are believed to result from asymptomatic or mild Covid-19\" followed by a hyper-inflammatory response that appears to occur when the patients\\' bodies have produced their maximum level of antibodies to the virus.However, experts were not able to file any concrete findings on the reason behind such a high rate of inflammatory syndrome in younger children.\"It means primary-care pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion for this because Covid is so prevalent in the society and children often have an asymptomatic disease as their initial Covid infection,\" said Dr. Jennifer Blumenthal, a pediatric intensivist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children\\'s Hospital, who was not involved in the study.The researchers evaluated 1,733 of the 2,090 cases of the syndrome in people age 20 and younger that had been reported to the CDC as of January.The findings show that although the syndrome is rare, it can be serious. The CDC\\'s data only included patients who were hospitalized. Over 90 per cent of those young people experienced symptoms involving at least four organ systems and 58 percent needed treatment in intensive care units.Many experienced significant heart issues: over half developed low blood pressure, 37 per cent developed cardiogenic shock and 31 per cent experienced cardiac dysfunction involving their heart\\'s inability to pump adequately.The study further said that a significantly higher percentage of patients who had not had Covid-19 symptoms experienced those heart problems, compared with those who had initial coronavirus symptoms.A greater percentage of initially asymptomatic patients also ended up in intensive care, reported the New York Times.\"Even the kids with severe MIS-C, who was in the I.C.U. -- the vast majority of them did not have a preceding illness that they recognized,\" said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of infectious diseases at Children\\'s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the research.The study provided the most detailed demographic and geographic picture of the syndrome to date.About 34 per cent of the patients were Black and 37 percent were Hispanic, reflecting the way that the coronavirus has disproportionately affected members of those communities.As the pandemic went on, the authors wrote, the proportion of patients who were white increased, comprising 20 percent of all cases. People of Asian heritage comprised just over 1 percent of patients.Overall, nearly 58 per cent of the patients were male, but the proportion was not the same across all ages. The youngest group -- newborn to age 4 -- had roughly equal numbers of boys and girls, and the male-to-female ratio increased in the older groups until it was more than two-to-one male to female in the 18-to-20 group.The vast majority of patients (nearly 86 percent) were younger than 15. The study found that those under 5 had the lowest risk of serious heart complications and were less likely to need intensive care. Patients 10 and older were significantly more likely to develop issues like shock, low blood pressure, and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle).\"I think that\\'s similar to what we saw with Covid, that the older kids seemed to have more severe disease,\" Dr. DeBiasi said. \"And that\\'s because what makes people really sick from the Covid is the inflammatory aspect of it, so maybe these older kids, for whatever reasons, make more inflammation, whether that\\'s in primary Covid or MIS-C.\"Children 14 and under were more likely to have a rash and red eyes, while those older than 14 were more likely to have chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough. Abdominal pain and vomiting afflicted about two-thirds of all patients.There were 24 deaths recorded, spread across all age groups. There was no information in the study about whether patients had underlying medical conditions, but doctors and researchers have reported that young people with MIS-C were often previously healthy and significantly more likely to be healthy than the relatively small number of young people who become seriously ill from initial Covid infections.Similarly unclear are the reasons behind the study\\'s finding that in the first wave of MIS-C, from March 1 to July 1, 2020, young people were more prone to a few of the most serious heart complications. Dr. DeBiasi said that did not match the experience of her hospital, where \"the kids were sicker in the second wave.\"The study documented two waves of MIS-C cases that followed surges in overall coronavirus cases by about a month or more. \"The most recent third peak of the Covid-19 pandemic appears to be leading to another MIS-C peak perhaps involving urban and rural communities,\" the authors wrote.Dr. Blumenthal said, \"right now, we don\\'t know anything about how the variants necessarily affect children.\"Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' First Covid-19 vaccine shot alone not protective: Chile study  A study in Chile, which has one of the furthest-advanced vaccination campaigns in South America -- mainly with China\\'s Coronavac, has found that a first dose alone does not protect against coronavirus infection.The study by the University of Chile found inoculation to be 56.5 percent effective in protecting recipients two weeks after the second dose, and 27.7 percent effective within the first two weeks.But for a single dose, efficacy in the 28 days between the first and second dose was only three percent -- on par with the margin of error in such studies, it said.Researchers looked at the combined effect of Coronavac, which accounts for about 93 percent of doses being administered, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.It estimated Coronavac\\'s efficacy in real-life conditions at 54 percent -- in line with trial results in Brazil.The Pfizer jab has been estimated to be about 94 percent effective in an Israeli study.Chile has so far given at least one shot to 7.07 million people, and both shots to 4.04 of 15.2 million inhabitants being targeted for vaccination.Like the rest of Latin America, the country has seen a steep rise in new infections and has surpassed the daily rate of the first wave last year, with more than 8,000 new cases per day.\"Getting vaccinated very significantly decreases the possibility of infection, it does not eliminate it, but it decreases it a lot, therefore you have to get vaccinated,\" University of Chile rector Ennio Vivaldi told a virtual press conference.But it was also clear that the first dose on its own \"does not have any relevant effect after four weeks\" which means the recipient was for all intents and purposes just as vulnerable to infection as a non-vaccinated person.The study estimated that for people between 75 and 79 -- targeted in the initial vaccination campaign -- there would have been 80 percent more infections without the vaccine.For those aged 70 to 74, the percentage dropped to 60 percent.

              " ' Protests against CAA, farm laws part of a conspiracy: PM on BJP’s foundation day  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday warned Bharatiya Janata Party workers against “a system of narratives” being created around decisions of the central government “as part of a conspiracy”.In his address to BJP workers on the party’s 41st foundation day, the PM said that the people who call the party “an election-winning machine” do not understand the maturity of the Indian democracy.Referring to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, new farm laws and labour laws, the PM said, “[Whether it is] with regard to CAA or the farm laws or the labour laws, every worker should understand that there is politics behind this and a big conspiracy.”Protests erupted across the country after Parliament passed the CAA to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan in 2019.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since November last year against the three farm laws passed in September.Alleging that there is an attempt to create political instability in the country, the PM said, “…therefore, all rumours are being spread; fears are being stoked and lies are being told. Imaginary fears are being created. Sometimes it is said that the Constitution will be changed, sometimes that reservation will be withdrawn. Sometimes they say citizenship will be withdrawn and sometimes they say farmers’ lands will be taken…”He blamed those “who cannot accept their defeat” for creating fear and wrong narratives for political benefit.Modi said when other parties win elections, they and their leaders are feted. He added in the case of the BJP, electoral wins are “perceived with double standards”.“Those who say we are an election-winning machine cannot understand the maturity of the Indian democracy and the intelligence of the voters. They cannot understand the hopes and aspirations of the Indian voters,” he said.“We are moving ahead taking along every region and community. We are everywhere. We are a party of national interest as well as regional aspirations. We do not believe in political untouchability,” he said, adding that secularism has been transformed to mean policies according to the vote banks and favours only for a few.“Those who make policies and programmes for everyone and speak about the rights of all are called communal. But Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas has begun to change these definitions,” he said.He said the parties that talked about regional aspirations have become family-owned parties. “These parties wore a fake mask of secularism which is now being taken off,” he said.Modi’s comments came on the day of polling to elect 475 assembly members across four states — West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam — and Union territory of Puducherry.Reacting to the PM’s speech, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “...The criticism of the so-called new BJP of Modi and Shah is that in its blind search for electoral victory, it has jettisoned all norms of fair play, inclusiveness, political magnanimity and political ethics.”Political commentator Ajay Kumar Jha said since 2014, the BJP under Modi has been challenging the established narrative. “The national narrative is being challenged by the BJP under Modi’s leadership and that is getting a very aggressive reaction from the established socio-political and intellectual groups. They have not been able to accept the changes in terms of the BJP’s rise and therefore find a negative connotation to the party’s electoral performance.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics bjp prime minister narendra modi ',\n",
              " ' No place for DC\\'s costliest buys of IPL 2021 in Chopra\\'s ideal Delhi Capitals XI  The upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) is expected to be full of surprises for Delhi Capitals as they are set to enter the competition under a young leader – Rishabh Pant. The runners-up of the previous season will begin their journey against three-time champions Chennai Super Kings on Saturday at Mumbai’s iconic Wankhede Stadium.Besides keeping a tab on Rishabh Pant’s output as a captain, the DC think tank will also face the challenge of finalising a strong XI which can pose threat to MS Dhoni’s CSK. Meanwhile, former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra has suggested an ideal DC XI for IPL 2021.The former India opener threw in a few surprises by not picking England\\'s Tom Curran (bought for ₹5.25 Cr) and Australia\\'s Steve Smith (bought for ₹2.2 Cr) - two of DC\\'s costliest picks in the auctions ahead of this IPL - in his ideal Delhi Capitals XI for starters.Also Read | ‘You have to bite the bullet’: Ganguly remembers biggest setback of careerIn the video on his YouTube channel, the cricketer-turned-commentator suggested that Ajinkya Rahane should bat at No 3 position, so that the management could play the likes of Shimron Hetmyer and Marcus Stoinis in the lower-middle order.“Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw to open. At three, I want to play Ajinkya Rahane because if Rahane is at three then you can play both Shimron Hetmyer and Marcus Stoinis. So Rahane at three, Pant at four and Hetmyer and Stoinis at No.5 and No.6. This looks like a very decent top six to me,\" said Chopra.The former Indian cricketer further opined that the absence of Axar Patel in the first few games might affect DC’s balance. However, Chopra also suggested that leg-spinner Amit Mishra can share the responsibilities with Ravichandran Ashwin in the spin department.Also Read | Aakash Chopra picks his ideal RCB XI for IPL 2021, leaves out 2 prominent Australians“There could be a few problems in the initial matches because you would have wanted Axar at No.7. If you put Ashwin at No.7, you will feel the batting is a little short. So, the first couple of games they might be struggling to find the right balance. But after that you play Ashwin and Axar, you can play Mishra also along with Ashwin,” said. Chopra.“Then you have got Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada and play one out of Ishant and Umesh and your team is complete,” he added. Aakash Chopra’s ideal DC XI for IPL 2021:Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Rishabh Pant, Shimron Hetmyer, Marcus Stoinis, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Umesh Yadav / Ishant Sharma.

              " \" Petrol and diesel prices in your city. Check today's rates here  Fuel prices held steady across the country on Wednesday for the eighth consecutive day. The prices of petrol and diesel were lowered on Tuesday last week following a reduction in the international crude prices. Before Tuesday, the fuel prices were not changed for four consecutive days. According to data available on the Indian Oil Corporation’s (IOC) website on Wednesday, the price of one litre of petrol in Delhi was ₹90.56 and diesel was priced at ₹80.87. In Mumbai, petrol is currently retailing at ₹96.98 and diesel costs ₹87.96.Fuel is priced differently in various states owing to the taxes levied on them by both central as well as state governments along with freight charges. These taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The fuel prices are generally revised on a daily basis in tandem with the benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.Here’s what you will pay for a litre of petrol and diesel in your city on Wednesday (April 7): City Petrol (Rs/litre) Diesel (Rs/litre) Delhi 90.56 80.87 Mumbai 96.98 87.96 Kolkata 90.77 83.75 Chennai 92.58 85.88 Bengaluru 93.59 85.75 Hyderabad 94.16 88.20 Bhopal 98.58 89.13 Patna 92.89 86.12 Lucknow 88.85 81.27 Noida 88.91 81.33 In the international markets, oil prices edged higher on Wednesday according to a report in news agency Reuters, on account of hopes reviving for stronger global economic growth due to the increase in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccinations. Brent crude futures for June rose by 34 cents to $63.08 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude for May was also up by 32 cents or 0.5 per cent, to $59.65. Oil prices also rose on Tuesday as data on US job openings showed an almost two-year high. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday that an increase in public spending to fight Covid-19, especially by the United States, would push global growth to 6 per cent this year, news agency Reuters reported.

              " \" Next round of military talks on LAC row likely on April 9  The 11th round of India-China military dialogue may take place on April 9 to resolve the friction at Gogra-Hot Springs and restoring the pre-April 2020 status quo ante along the 1,597-kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC) in East Ladakh, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The Indian Army also wants to resolve long-standing patrolling issues at Depsang Bulge due to friction in the area during the 2013 stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army.“The dialogue will most probably take place on Friday (April 9) but a confirmation is still awaited from the PLA side,” said a senior official. He, however, insisted that there is no delay from the Chinese side.While the situation on both banks of Pangong Tso is stable with the PLA and Indian Army going back to pre-April 2020 positions, a score of Chinese soldiers is still to restore status quo ante in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, or patrolling points 15 and 17 as per the Indian military lexicon.Also Read| ‘Russia closely watching LAC developments’: Foreign minister Sergey LavrovThe last round of military talks to resolve border tensions that began last May was held on February 20. This meeting stretched for 16 hours and ended with two sides agreeing that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided them with a “good basis” to resolve the outstanding issues at friction points in “a steady and orderly” manner.Indian Army commanders believe that the differences between the two sides at the Gogra-Hot Springs area were relatively a minor issue as compared to the diversion of views on the strategic heights on both banks Pangong Tso. But there is recognition that the talks could go either way though the army has approached the dialogue with an open mind.The 11th round of military talks comes at a time China is concerned about the QUAD security dialogue and the effort to raise the pressure on Beijing to loosen its hold over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Leaders of the four-member Quad grouping — the United States, India, Japan and Australia — held their first summit on March 12 to address concerns about Beijing’s growing economic and military heft. A meeting of US-China officials at Anchorage on March 18 also ended acrimoniously, making it clear that there was no possibility of a revival in US-China bilateral ties in a hurry despite the change in the White House.Also Read| China sees a 'weak India', says Rahul, explains why Cong is not winning pollTo add to China’s concern is the concerted effort by powers such as France and the United Kingdom to expand their footprint in the Indo-Pacific and India playing a pivotal role in the region, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Navies of France-plus Quad countries are already in the middle of exercises in the Bay of Bengal, with French carrier strike force led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will participate in the trilateral naval exercise along with the Indian and the United Arab Emirates navies in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman later this month.Officials suggest it is not clear these developments would impact the military talks. With both the US and China accusing each other of grand-standing at the Anchorage meeting last month, the PLA may either harden its stance or soften its attitude towards the resolution of Gogra-Hot Springs. The Indian Army, which has prepared for a long haul at the friction points, is also keeping a close watch on the entire 3488 km LAC as most stand-offs with PLA take place in April and May during exercises in Tibet and Xinjiang by the Western Theatre Command based in Chengdu.

              " ' Maldives is Indians’ new favourite holiday destination during the pandemic  Indians are jetting off to the Maldives in ever greater numbers to escape the coronavirus pandemic.Visitors from the South Asian nation to the sandy paradise known for its clear water and white beaches jumped 50% to just over 44,000 in the first two months of the year versus 2020, figures from the island nation’s ministry of tourism show. Arrivals from China, Japan and South Korea were down around 98%. Tourists from India also made up 23.3% of the total in the two months, the most from any single country.India reached a grim milestone on April 5 when the government reported over 100,000 new cases on a single day for the first time. The second wave has shuttered businesses once again and sent some cities back into lockdown, triggering a desire to holiday in far-flung destinations. The country’s vaccine roll out has also been slow -- at this rate, it will take 2.4 years to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose jab.“The Maldives remains the top pick for Indians,” said Pradeep Sharma, owner of Kolkata-based Agwani Travels. “It used to be a high-end destination but now the Maldives is offering good deals on hotels and people have limited options. Thailand hasn’t opened up, Southeast Asia hasn’t opened up. All the Bollywood film stars are doing promotions.”Local airlines are sensing opportunity, too. Vistara, a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines Ltd., started non-stop Mumbai to Male flights under a travel bubble agreement between India and Maldives last month, becoming the only airline to offer premium economy class on the route.“Maldives is one of the most popular holiday destinations among travelers, not just in India, but from around the world,” Vistara’s Chief Executive Officer Leslie Thng said.The ease of entry is also a big sell. The Maldives has exempted all tourists from mandatory quarantine if passengers test negative for Covid 96 hours before their departure. That’s in contrast to other countries such as the UK where overseas trips are effectively banned and any incoming travelers must take multiple Covid tests and undergo quarantine.Sharma said he is seeing a “drastic” jump in bookings. “There’s a more than 500% increase,” he said.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' Foden outshines Haaland to give City 2-1 lead over Dortmund in CL quarter  Still opponents rather than teammates, Phil Foden showed Erling Haaland there\\'s already a 20-year-old excelling at Manchester City.Foden netted City\\'s 90th-minute goal to clinch a 2-1 victory over Haaland\\'s Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday — and even before that it was the local lad repeatedly flaunting his skills on the ball to bamboozle the visitors.“They are a young team full of energy and they counterattack really quick,” Foden said. “I was frustrated all night. I had many chances to score and I kept going and in the end one paid off.\"Haaland, who is being touted as a potential replacement for Sergio Aguero at City next season, didn\\'t have the best of auditions to live up to a valuation far exceeding $100 million. European football\\'s hottest young talent struggled to make an impact, beyond setting up an equalizer on the turn for captain Marco Reus to cancel out Kevin De Bruyne\\'s first-half strike.And it was Foden who played an integral part in that City opener that followed Emre Can giving the ball away and De Bruyne leading the breakaway. Foden squared to Riyad Mahrez, who kept the ball in play at the far post before pulling it back for De Bruyne to clip into the net in the 19th minute.And with City entering the 90th minute facing going to Germany next week locked at 1-1, De Bruyne\\'s vision picked apart the Dortmund defense again.“I try to look up before I get the ball so I try to get a picture of what is happening,” the Belgian midfielder said. “I could see Phil and Gundo (Ilkay Gundogan) running to the post and tried to chip it.”It succeeded, as De Bruyne sent a perfectly weighted ball floating over the Dortmund defense. Gundogan brought down the cross at the far post and laid the ball off for Foden to sweep into the net.“The second goal right at the end was unnecessary, because we lost concentration for two seconds,” Reus said. “We need to be stopping the cross there.\"While Foden was the match-winner, Haaland still took the opportunity to chat with his young counterpart with mouths covered on the freezing Etihad pitch. And the Norwegian had one final duty before heading into the dressing room, improbably being asked by one of referee Ovidiu Haţegan\\'s assistants, Octavian Sovre, to sign red and yellow cards.“Maybe he’s a fan of Haaland,” City manager Pep Guardiola quipped.Dortmund is insistent that Haaland won’t be linking up next season with City — or any other team.“He’s our player and we are very proud he’s part of our team,” Terzić said.As for Haţegan, the referee rightly overturned a penalty originally awarded against Can for fouling City midfielder Rodri in the first half before enraging Dortmund by denying Jude Bellingham an equalizer before halftime.Ederson was trying to control a back pass on the edge of the penalty area but gave the ball away and Bellingham nipped in to score. But Bellingham was penalized for fouling Ederson despite being kicked first and the whistle had already gone before the 17-year-old Englishman put the ball in the net.While Dortmund protested the decision on the pitch, City’s midfielder Fernandinho turned from his seat in the stands toward the media sitting behind him to argue the opposite. “It’s a foul,” he said in the stadium that remains without fans during the pandemic.It contributed to Dortmund heading into the second leg trailing, albeit with a valuable away goal secured by Reus netting in the Champions League for the first time since October 2018.“We didn’t trust ourselves to go forward so much in the first half,\" Reus said. \"We set up well, but it’s such a shame that we didn’t get the reward for the fight and the energy that we showed on the pitch. ”Winning the Champions League for the first time since 1997 might be the only way for Dortmund to return to the competition as it sits in fifth place in the Bundesliga — seven points from fourth.“They are the best side in the world at the moment,” Dortmund coach Edin Terzić said of City. “But we annoyed them a lot and we are still in the game.”City by contrast is running away with the Premier League, building a 14-point lead in its quest for a third title in four seasons to dethrone struggling Liverpool. While City remains on track for a quadruple, Liverpool lost 3-1 at Real Madrid in the night’s other first leg. This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " \" Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 in 1st leg of CL quarterfinals  Vinícius Júnior scored a goal in each half as Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 3-1 in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday.Marco Asensio also scored for Madrid, which took full advantage of Liverpool's defensive blunders in the first half to take a commanding lead ahead of the second leg in England.Mohamed Salah netted the lone goal for Liverpool early in the second half before Vinícius Júnior sealed the victory for the hosts.The game was a rematch of the 2018 Champions League final won by Madrid, which since then was eliminated in the tournament’s round of 16 two years in a row. Liverpool won the title following the loss to Madrid but was also eliminated in the round of 16 last season.Manchester City defeated Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at home in the other quarterfinal on Tuesday.Liverpool, which recently endured a run of poor results in the Premier League, looked lost at the start of the match at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium in Madrid, unable to get a shot on goal in the first half.Vinícius Júnior opened the scoring on a breakaway in the 27th after a perfectly timed long pass over the top by Toni Kroos. The Brazilian forward made a nice run between Liverpool defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold and Nathaniel Phillips then chested the ball down before firing a low right-footed shot from inside the area past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.Another long pass by Kroos — and a defensive blunder by Liverpool — led to Asensio’s second goal in the 36th. Alexander-Arnold tried to clear the ball from Kroos but headed it across the area directly to Asensio, who flipped the ball over the charging Becker and finished the move on the other side to push it into the open net.Liverpool complained of a foul by Lucas Vázquez on Sadio Mané just moments before Madrid’s second goal.The English side improved after the break and was able to pull one back early in the second half with Salah finding the net from close range after a shot by Diogo Jota was partially blocked by Luka Modric in the 51st. The goal had to be confirmed by video review because of a possible offside by Salah.With the goal, Salah became the fifth Liverpool player to score in four consecutive European appearances.Asensio, who scored in each of Madrid’s last four games in all competitions, squandered the chance to increase Madrid’s lead on a breakaway in the 64th. But a minute later, Vinícius Júnior didn’t miss his opportunity after a pass by Modric, finding the net with a shot from near the penalty spot.Liverpool had kept four consecutive clean sheets away from home going into the game in Madrid. It has not had five in a row in away games this century.Madrid got the win even though its defensive problems compounded just before the game as Raphael Varane tested positive for the coronavirus. Captain Sergio Ramos had already been ruled out because of an injury.Coach Zinedine Zidane used reserves Éder Militão and Nacho Fernández in central defense, and had to move away from a 3-5-2 formation that he had preferred to use in previous games.

              " ' ‘You have to bite the bullet’: Ganguly remembers biggest setback of career  Sourav Ganguly is one of the most celebrated Indian cricketers of all time due to his achievements on the field and his leadership skills. After bringing an end to his cricket career, Ganguly has gone on to overtake administrative duties in cricket. He is the current Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) president and is overseeing cricket affairs in the country.He has been through many ups and downs in his career but every fan remembers the contribution of ‘Dada’ to Indian cricket. Ganguly is credited with installing a fighting spirit among the Indian cricketers and giving a platform to many young players like Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, MS Dhoni, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh etc to perform for their country.However, Ganguly also went through a period where things did not go in his way. He remembered the biggest setbacks of his career which was when he was stripped of his captaincy in 2005. Ganguly maintained that ‘life has no guarantees\\' and you have to deal with the pressure.Also Read | \\'Played with a lot of Englishmen, Australians, West Indians, they just give up on mental health\\': Ganguly\"You just have to deal with it. It\\'s the mindset that you get into. Life has no guarantees, be it in sport, business or whatever. You go through ups and downs. You just have to bite the bullet. Pressure is a huge thing in everybody\\'s life. All of us go through different pressures.\"When you play your first Test, it\\'s the pressure of making yourself established and making the world know that you belong at this level.\"And when you go to that level after playing many number of matches, it\\'s about keeping up the performances. A little bit of blip and it doesn\\'t stop people from scrutinising you and that adds to athletes in a long way,\" he added.Commenting on bio-bubbles, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has said that Indians are \"more tolerant\" to deal with mental health issues than cricketers from countries like England and Australia.Ever since the international cricket resumed, the players have been forced to stay in bio-bubbles, where their life is restricted to hotels and stadiums. They do not have access to people outside the bubble, making it extremely difficult for players to stay fresh and motivated.\"I feel we Indians are a bit more tolerant than overseas (cricketers).

              " ' BJP internal assessment: Nandigram a contest  The Bharatiya Janata Party has classified each of West Bengal’s 294 constituencies into one of three categories, A, B, and C, depending on the nature of the contest, according to six BJP leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity. A refers to an easy win, B, a contest, and C, a very tough contest. Nandigram, where Trinamool Congress leader and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is taking on Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP is in category B, HT learns.On record, however, the BJP says none of the 294 seats is difficult. “It is the first time our party has gone to 80,000 of the total 100,000 polling booths that we have across the state. We have classified them, but it is our internal preparation. It is our strategy but we hope that people will vote for us whichever category the constituency is,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya, national general secretary in charge of Bengal. Home minister Amit Shah has repeatedly said the BJP will win at least 200 seats. When asked specifically about CM’s constituency, Vijayvargiya said “Nandigram is in A category.”Also watch | Mamata Banerjee Vs Suvendu Adhikari: Who is in pole position in Nandigram?\\ufeff \\ufeffThe categorisation has been done by top BJP strategists , and the list itself is with only some of the party’s top leaders and campaigners, HT has learnt.One of the people cited in the first instance said that while Nandigram looks like a contest, “the BJP may be slightly ahead.”Similarly, Tollygunge, where Union minister Babul Supriyo is fighting from is also in category B, the people added.Supriyo acknowledged that he has been given a tough seat, but added that he is confident of winning. “It is a serious but also a ground zero assessment of the organisation in terms of the constituencies which need extra support,’’ he said of his constituency’s categorisation.So which are the toughest or category C seats for the BJP? The internal survey says that these are the constituencies mostly in South Bengal — Swarupnagar, Baranagar, Basanti, Jagatballavpur, Khandagosh, Murarai, Nalgoti and Manbazar — that are dominated by the TMC.Most of the headline-grabbing constituencies, however, are in Category B. Other than Nandigram, Sitai, Moyna, Raipur, Kotulpur, Indas, Galsi, Katwa, Memari, and even Tarkeshwar, where former Rajya Sabha MP and journalist Swapan Dasgupta is fighting from, are all in this category. “I cannot comment on this because I have never come across such a survey,’’ said Dasgupta when contacted by HT.The easiest, or category A, seats for BJP include Onda, Bishnupur, Asansol (dakshin) , Para, Joypur, Shibpur, Khejuri, Medinipur, Howrah Uttar. Other than Howrah, they are mostly in the Western parts of the state.“We are winning Bengal. We have won Nandigram. The only Union minister contesting here will lose,” said Derek O’ Brien, TMCs leader in the Rajya Sabha.“In the western districts of Bengal, the BJP did better in 2019, so they classify them as easier seats to win. In southern and eastern Bengal, despite several charges of corruption against TMC, it has organisational presence so the BJP will face opposition from certain demographics,” said Dwaipayan Bhattacharya, professor for political science at JNU, explaining the logic behind the categorisation.

              " ' Karnataka bus strike from today, public transport likely to be affected  Under the banner of Karnataka State Road Transport Employees League, workers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), have given a call for an indefinite strike from Wednesday citing state government’s failure to implement salary system under the 6th pay commission for the workers of road transportation corporation. The strike is likely to affect public transport in the state.Here’s everything you need to know about the Karnataka transport strike from Wednesday:1. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa appealed to road transportation corporation workers not to hold the strike. “We have fulfilled eight out of your (workers) nine demands. We have to work together for the welfare of the people. Without giving room for the government to take strict measures, drop the strike and cooperate with the administration,” CM Yediyurappa said on Tuesd.2. The Karnataka government has warned of strict action against the workers if the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions are not followed. \"There are Covid-19 restrictions in place and a notification has already been issued under the Disaster Management Act stating that people cannot gather in groups. If it is violated, action will be taken under the act, also IPC, police act among others,\" state chief secretary Kumar said. \"Their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report, and thereby give them the salary on par with the government employees, cannot be accepted,\" Kumar added.3. With the aim to reduce inconvenience of the general public, the state government has made alternative arrangements for transport by roping in private operators. The government has also deployed more trains to places like Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Hubballi, Mysuru among others.4. The state government has also allowed the state road transport corporation to hire private buses and school buses for transportation, according to news agency ANI.5. The government has also said that strict action will be taken against autos and cabs if they charge higher fares taking advantage of the transport strike. Keeping in account the same, the government has issued a notification fixing cab and bus fares. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics karnataka bus strike ',\n",
              " ' ‘Glad we took it’: Odisha couple urges others to dispel rumours about vaccine  Last year, Shiva Prasad Rath lost three relatives — a sister and two brothers-in-law — to the coronavirus disease. “All in a period of eight months,” said Rath, a 73-year-old former government employee from Odisha. “It was just horrific.”Rath lives with his wife, Swapna (64), in Bhubaneswar. The Raths could not attend the last rites of their relatives, two of which took place in September. In November, another sister and brother-in-law were hospitalised; this time, his sister survived, but her husband died.At the time, the caseload in Odisha was 294,457; as of April 6, 2021, the number of cases in the state is 343,856 and 1,975 people have died till date.“It was so scary,” said Swapna, a teacher, who stopped giving tuition classes when the lockdown began on March 25, 2020. “I didn’t even see the front gate of my house [for several months],” Rath said, alluding to how they stayed indoors through the lockdown and even after it was lifted. They got their vegetables delivered, they put off a visit to the cardiologist — necessary for Rath who had a stent inserted a decade ago — and they avoided all public places, including temples.The fear, said the Raths, was also driven by the number of messages over social media messaging platforms that began to circulate shortly after the vaccination drive started in the country. “There were so many videos and messages. One said that people with high blood pressure would fall down senseless after getting a shot; one said there were no guarantees of whether there would be any side-effects after vaccination,” Swapna said. Rath had an additional worry. The Covaxin fact sheet states that people on blood thinners should inform their health care providers. Initially, this led to widespread confusion about whether there were certain drugs that had contraindications for vaccination. The ICMR subsequently issued a clarification towards the end of January that both Covid vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — approved for use in India were safe for people on such medication.All the same, Rath went to a doctor just to be sure, and the doctor advised him to take the jab.On March 25, the Raths visited a vaccination centre at the Hi-Tech Medical College & Hospital, close to their home, and got their first dose of the vaccine. “The process was very easy,” Rath said.Rath experienced some degree of tiredness after taking the shot. “I think it was psychological...,” Swapna said, adding that she only felt a little pain in the arm after the shot.The companies manufacturing these vaccines — Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (Covishield) — have published a list of possible side effects the respective vaccines could lead to. These range from pain at the injection site to chills, body ache and nausea.It was a very good thought, Swapna said, to think of senior citizens as the first group after health care workers, to get the shot. The main lesson from the pandemic, Swapna said, was that it is possible to take care of oneself — healthy diet, regular exercise, and “wearing masks at all times” but that “a little bit of fear [of the pandemic] is also a good thing, because it ensures that we follow rules”.The Raths rue the fact that the “younger generation” doesn’t wear masks or maintains social distancing anymore.“But there is nothing scary about taking the vaccine. We’re glad we did it, said Swapna. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus ',\n",

              " \" Amazon boss Bezos backs Biden's proposal to hike US corporate tax rate  Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos endorsed President Joe Biden’s focus on building up the country’s infrastructure Tuesday and said the company even supports a corporate tax rate hike to help pay for it.Also Read | Biden's economic plan gets boost from Senate procedural rulingBezos’ statement, posted on the company’s website, was notable because it came after Biden singled out the company for criticism about how much it pays in federal taxes when he recently unveiled his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal.Biden has proposed hiking the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% to help pay for his plan, an idea that Republican leaders are panning as harmful to economic growth. Democrats will surely cite support from individual companies to undercut that argument.“We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what’s included as well as how it gets paid for (we’re supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate),” Bezos wrote. “We look forward to Congress and the Administration coming together to find the right, balanced solution that maintains or enhances U.S. competitiveness.”Bezos was careful not to endorse a specific plan. Rather, he said “we support the Biden Administration’s focus on making bold investments in American infrastructure.”Also Read | Joe Biden's infrastructure plan to boost job growth, says economic adviserThe company would benefit from the investments made in roads, bridges, airports and broadband. Business groups have joined in the call for more public works investment by the federal government, but they have generally balked at Biden’s call for raising the corporate income tax, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce describing Biden’s proposal as “dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure.”Along with partially undoing the corporate tax cut put in place during President Donald Trump’s administration, Biden also wants to set a minimum U.S. tax on overseas corporate income, and to make it harder for companies to shift earnings offshore.Amazon has long been criticized for paying virtually no federal taxes in the U.S. for years even as it built an e-commerce empire that currently has a market value of $1.6 trillion.That has changed slightly in recent years as the Seattle company has become more profitable. Last year, it reported paying $1.7 billion in federal taxes on its U.S. income of $20.2 billion, working out to an effective tax rate of about 8%. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON \",\n",

It\\'s a biological Fukushima,\" said Miguel Nicolelis, a Brazilian doctor and professor at Duke University, who is closely tracking the virus.On Tuesday, the Health Ministry reported another 4,195 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, well above the country\\'s prior single-day record. Brazil has set daily death records every week since late February, as a more contagious local variant and meager social distancing efforts fuel an uncontrolled outbreak.With mass vaccinations curtailing the U.S. outbreak, Brazil has become the epicenter of the pandemic, contributing about one in four deaths per day globally, according to a Reuters analysis.President Jair Bolsonaro has pushed back against mask-wearing and lockdowns that public health experts consider the best way to lessen virus transmission.The country dragged its feet last year as the world raced to secure vaccines, slowing the launch of a national immunization program.Despite the recent surge, Brazilian officials are insistent that the country can soon return to something resembling business as usual.\"We think that probably two, three months from now Brazil could be back to business,\" Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said during an online event on Tuesday. \"Of course, probably economic activity will take a drop but it will be much, much less than the drop we suffered last year ... and much, much shorter.\"Bolsonaro has responded to growing political pressure with a dramatic shakeup of a half dozen ministries, putting loyalists in key roles ahead of what may be a tough re-election campaign next year against his political nemesis.While the president has shifted his tone on immunizations, touting vaccines he had recently disdained, the far-right former army captain continues to battle in the courts against state and municipal restrictions on economic activity.With weak measures failing to combat contagion, Brazil\\'s Covid-19 cases and deaths are accumulating faster than ever.Nicolelis and Christovam Barcellos, a researcher at Brazilian medical institute Fiocruz, are separately forecasting that Brazil could surpass the United States in both overall deaths and the record for average deaths per day.As soon as next week, Brazil may break the record U.S. seven-day average for Covid-19 deaths, according to a model by the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The U.S. average for daily deaths peaked at 3,285 in January.The IHME forecast does not currently extend beyond July 1, when it projects Brazil could reach 563,000 deaths, compared with 609,000 total U.S. fatalities expected by then.

An estimate of about 20,000 doses, 5,000 shots a week is administered by the non profit.At one point Biden leaned over and whispered to the workers: \"We passed 150 million yesterday.\"Approaching three people receiving a shot near where the pool was held, POTUS said: \"You\\'re doing the right thing...really important. And when you go back when you go home, get all your friends, tell them, \\'Get a shot when they can,\\'\" he said. \"We\\'re going to be able - everyone\\'s going to be able to before the month is out. Every age.\"The US president reassured people and said: \"All these strains you\\'re hearing about. You should not worry.\"\"They are more virulent. They are ...more dangerous but the vaccines work on all of them.\"\"Hopefully we\\'re going to get good enough, pretty soon, where we have enough that we can give the rest of the world. Because this is something that\\'s not just... we can solve it here in America. We don\\'t solve it around the world - you can\\'t build a wall or fence high enough to keep out a virus,\" he said.Asked if the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was behind us, POTUS said: \"I think If everyone continues down the road that we\\'re on now, it will be behind us but it\\'s not over yet. We\\'re in a situation where I believe by end of the summer, we\\'ll have a significant portion of the American public vaccinated.\"Later at the White House Biden announced that every adult in the US will be eligible to be vaccinated for COVId-19 by April 19, which is two weeks earlier than May 1 deadline that Biden had previously targeted.\"By no later than April 19, every adult aged 18 years and above will be eligible to be vaccinated. No more confusing rules. No more confusing restrictions\" said Biden In his remarks at the White House on Tuesday.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 167m doses have so far been administered in the US. While 40 per cent of adults have received at least one shot, about a quarter have completed their course of vaccinations, including 55 per cent of people aged over 65.Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it has awarded Virginia $77.1 million to support local efforts to increase vaccine uptake by expanding COVID-19 vaccine programs and ensuring greater equity and access to vaccine by those disproportionately affected by the virus.The United States is averaging more than 64,000 new cases each day, a 20 percent increase from two weeks earlier, the NYT reported adding the country is averaging over 800 Covid-19 deaths each day, the lowest level since November.

              " ' Brothers in arms in Maoist ambush: One looks for sibling, other mourns his loss  Raipur: Around 1.30pm on Saturday, as Maoist bullets rained on security forces in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, Hemant Andrik met his elder brother, Kishore.The siblings, both district reserve guard ( DRG) personnel, were exhausted. For 90 minutes, they had been firing relentlessly to break free from an U-shaped ambush that eventually killed 22 personnel.Hemant and four members of his team had just shot their way from lower ground onto a hillock and were resting, when they saw Kishore and four members of his team approach from another direction. At the time, around 350 personnel were still trapped by the surprise attack at the borders of Sukma and Bijapur districts.They stopped, greeted each other, and chatted for a few minutes. “We had broken the ambush…Kishore bhaiyya and his team were on the hilltop and firing to give us cover. Ten minutes later, Kishore bhaiyya came down with his team and we met near a rock. I told him to keep moving and meet me around 300 metres ahead,” Hemant said.It was the last time they saw each other.The brothers decided to rendezvous at a small hut nearby that soldiers frequented to drink water. But as Hemant advanced through the gunfire, he found it increasingly difficult to dodge bullets, and was separated from his team. “There was continuous firing from both sides. Maoists were using Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) hence it was not easy to move ahead…I told my brother to move... It was sheer luck that I was not hit and managed to cross the ambush,” Hemant said. But in the frenzy, he could not stop at the hut, and moved ahead.When Kishore reached the hut, he stopped for a sip of water, and asked the soldiers present if they had seen Hemant. When they replied in the negative, Kishore determined that his younger brother must have been hit by the Maoists, and decided to go back into the gunfire to rescue him. “The other soldiers requested him not to go in the ambush again, but he told them he has to save his brother,” Hemant said.“I should have stopped at the hut, come what may,” he added, filled with regret.Around 3pm, Hemant returned to the Terrem camp, where helicopters were rescuing the injured. He waited for his brother, but in vain. Eventually, he asked other soldiers if they had seen Kishore, but no one had. “They told me my brother might be with some other team because all teams were scattered after the ambush,” he said.He waited until 9pm, when other soldiers told him that Kishore was asking for him at the hut, and had likely walked back into the attack. Hemant was still hopeful of his elder brother being alive, but on Sunday morning, Kishore’s body was discovered.The brothers resided in Cherlapal village of Bijapur district; Hemant joined the DRG in 2012 while his brother was inducted about 18 months earlier. Kishore is survived by his wife, who is pregnant with their first child.Senior officials confirmed the events. “Kishore was a brave jawan and was also with me for some time. He went inside the ambush again after not finding his brother and died. This is very painful,” said Abhishek Singh, a deputy superintendent of police in Bijapur district .Since Saturday, Hemant hasn’t been able to sleep. “Kishore bhaiyya was brave and ultimate fighter. He loved me so much. I can’t believe he’s gone,” he said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics chhattisgarh maoist attack ',\n",
              " ' Starting today, night curfew in Delhi from 10 pm to 5 am amid rising Covid cases  The Delhi government on Tuesday clamped a curfew on movement and assembly of people between 10pm and 5am every day until April 30, in an attempt to arrest spiking infections, mirroring similar restrictions in other major cities such as Mumbai reeling under the second wave of Covid-19 cases.Government officials, essential workers, those travelling to and from airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres or hospitals will be exempt from the seven-hour night curfew. All restaurants, markets, wedding halls, pubs and commercial establishments will have to now close by 10pm, but home delivery of food and other items will be allowed, said a senior government official.The night curfew is the first restriction imposed by the government in the Capital, where the rate of new cases has jumped 130% in just the past week. On Tuesday, the city recorded 5,100 cases and 17 deaths, the highest since November 27. The Capital also conducted more than 100,000 tests for the first time since the pandemic hit the country last March. Experts are divided, however, over the efficiency of night curfews in curbing infections, especially in the absence of any other curbs.“The trend needs to be monitored, and we are keeping a close watch on it. Currently, the positivity rate has crossed the 5% mark for the entire country. However, in Delhi, we are completely alert and are being cautious,” said health minister Satyender Jain.On Tuesday, largely on account of the increasing testing, the positivity rate — a measure of positive cases to total tests conducted — dipped below 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization recommends must not be breached if testing is adequate. The rate had risen about 5% for the first time in the city in 124 days.The Delhi government order said the night curfew will come into effect immediately and be in force until April 30 or further orders.It added that employees of private companies and those involved in essential services will have to get e-passes for travelling within the city during the curfew. The e-passes applications are available on www.delhi.gov.in and passes will be required for those travelling for vaccination, which was expanded to operate 24 hours a day from Monday. Anyone with a medical emergency will also be exempted.Public transport, including Delhi Metro, shall function during the curfew hours for people exempted from the curbs.“The situation of Covid-19 in NCT [National Capital Territory] of Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a sudden increase in Covid-19 cases in recent past along with high positivity rate and therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi from 10pm to 5am, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure for well being and safety of people,” acting chief secretary Satya Gopal said, on behalf of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Night curfews are among the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions used by governments to check the pandemic in Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra.In Maharashtra, which is contributing roughly half of all cases in India, authorities have imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses to shut down, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said the night curfew will have a limited impact. “After 10pm, only restaurants, bars, and maybe some cinemas are open. All workplaces are closed, nobody goes to a mall after 10 o’clock...Simple measures like wearing a mask, staying at home, washing hands frequently, changing clothes soon after entering the home — these cannot be enforced all the time. And, ultimately these are the measures that help in curtailing the spread of the infection,” said Dr Khilnani.Delhi Police said it will enforce the rules, except for the exempted categories.“Delhi Police had earlier issued movement passes to facilitate the movement of persons engaged in essential services/commodities. Fresh movement passes will be issued on demand. Those requiring it and qualifying for it can also visit Delhi Police website to apply for it. All field functionaries will be available in their jurisdictions to enforce the DDMA order and to facilitate the exempted categories,” the police said in a statement. Officials said the police will start issuing passes in a few days to ease the application load on the state government’s website.In case anyone is found violating the instructions, the defaulting person(s) shall be proceeded against as per the provisions of sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws.The Delhi government order clarified that there was no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement, transportation of essential or non-essential goods. The order added no separate permission or e-passes will be required for such movement. Those arriving in the city at airports, railway stations, and interstate bus terminals will be allowed to travel on the production of valid tickets.A senior revenue official said the enforcement will be largely based on trust, like it was during the lockdown months last year. “The police and our enforcement officers are also able to judge who is telling the truth or who is faking it. No one will be distressed because of the curfew, but at the same time the rules will be followed in letter and spirit,” said the official on condition of anonymity.BS Vohra, president of east Delhi RWAs joint front, said the night curfew will create fear among the masses and make they stay indoors. “We support the move as it aims to discipline people and remind them that the virus is still far from gone. However, government should also launch a crackdown in markets and eating joints as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is brazenly being flouted,” he said.

              " ' Lavrov, Kerry ‘run into each other’ at hotel, have brief chat  Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and US special presidential envoy John Kerry met briefly in the Indian capital on Tuesday and talked about climate-related matters.Lavrov and Kerry were in India for separate bilateral meetings – the Russian minister met his Indian counterpart to prepare the grounds for an annual summit while the US envoy was holding talks aimed at mitigating India’s fossil energy use.“The two ran into each other by happenstance staying at the same hotel and chatted for a few minutes about climate,” the US embassy said without giving details.People familiar with developments on the Russian side also confirmed the encounter. The people said on condition of anonymity that the meeting was sought by the US side and lasted almost 15 minutes.Kerry, in his previous role as secretary of state in the Barack Obama administration, and Lavrov had played key roles in the protracted negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.The US embassy said that over the next few days, Kerry will meet with a range of representatives of the Indian government, private sector and non-governmental organisations.Lavrov travelled to Pakistan from India hours after his talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.

              " ' Talks to save Iran nuclear deal get off to good start  Iran, Russia and the United States reacted positively Tuesday to the opening exchanges in a first day of talks in Vienna aimed at rescuing an international agreement on Tehran\\'s nuclear programme.US President Joe Biden has said he is ready to reverse the decision of his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw from the landmark 2015 agreement, negotiated to ensure that Iran never developed a military nuclear programme.And after Moscow gave a positive assessment of the opening of the talks earlier Tuesday Washington\\'s reaction a little later was also upbeat. Iran too, described the opening talks as constructive.\"I can say that overall, the meeting was constructive,\" the head of the Iranian delegation, Abbas Araghchi, said in a video on Iranian broadcaster Irinn.The United States was not present at those discussions because Iran has refused to meet the US delegation so long as its sanctions against Tehran remain in place. The European Union is acting as an intermediary.Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia\\'s Vienna-based envoy to international organisations, said Tuesday\\'s meeting between those parties still in the deal -- Iran, China, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- had been \"successful\".It would take time to restore the agreement, he said.\"The most important thing after today\\'s meeting of the Joint Commission is that practical work towards achieving this goal has started,\" he tweeted.\"We do see this as a constructive and certainly welcome step,\" US State Department spokesman Ned Price said of the talks a little later.\"It is a potentially useful step as we seek to determine what it is that the Iranians are prepared to do to return to compliance with the stringent limitations under the 2015 deal, and as a result what we might need to do to return to compliance ourselves,\" he added.\\'Back on track\\'Since Trump pulled the US out of the deal with Iran in 2018, re-imposing sanctions on Tehran, the remaining parties have been struggling to save the agreement, as Iran has gradually stepped up its nuclear activities.Tehran is demanding an end to the crippling sanctions Trump imposed -- before which Iran will not meet the US delegates.Talks between the delegates from the remaining members of the 2015 agreement will continue Wednesday at the luxury hotel in Vienna, a diplomat familiar with the discussions said.The US delegation is due to meet in a different high-end hotel, also in downtown Vienna, with EU negotiators acting as go-betweens.At the same time, two expert-level groups -- on sanctions lifting and nuclear issues -- are working \"to identify concrete measures to be taken by Washington and Tehran\" to restore the deal, Ulyanov said.\"We need to make the best of this diplomatic space to bring the JCPOA back on track,\" said a tweet from EU diplomat Enrique Mora, the chair of Tuesday\\'s meeting, referring to the pact by its acronym.\"Our clear goal is to return to full and effective implementation of the agreement by all sides,\" he added.Ahead of the talks, US special envoy Rob Malley suggested that the United States could be open to lifting sanctions and returning to the deal, comments welcomed by Iran government spokesman Ali Rabiei.\"We find this position realistic and promising. It could be the start of correcting the bad process that had taken diplomacy to a dead end,\" he told reporters in Tehran.Iran confirmed in January it was enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, well beyond the threshold set by the deal.Rabiei reiterated Iran was ready to reverse the steps it had taken as soon as all sanctions imposed during the Trump administration are lifted.\\'Complex process\\'EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali warned of a \"complex process\" ahead, stressing that it was too soon to anticipate the outcome.It would take \"joint efforts\", she said, to see \"what sanctions can be lifted and how to settle the nuclear issue\".Kelsey Davenport, director for Non-proliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association think-tank, argued on the eve of the talks for a \"bold first step by both sides\" to inject \"much-needed momentum\" into the process.Washington, for example, could unfreeze Iranian funds held in foreign banks and facilitate humanitarian trade, and Tehran could stop enriching uranium beyond the levels agreed in the 2015 accord, said Davenport.

              " ' Key witness in George Floyd murder trial seeks to avoid testifying  A key witness in the trial of the Minneapolis police officer accused of murdering George Floyd sought Tuesday to avoid giving evidence as his lawyers said he could incriminate himself on separate charges.Morries Hall, who was with Floyd in his car shortly before his death, is in custody and appeared by video camera at the hearing after he was subpoenaed to testify.\"There\\'s really a very small narrow topic that might be permissible,\" Judge Peter Cahill said as Hall\\'s lawyers argued that it was impossible for him to be cross-examined without incriminating himself.Hall is seen as a potentially important witness for the defense of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who was seen in a phone video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed Floyd for more than nine minutes.The harrowing footage of Floyd\\'s May 25, 2020 arrest touched off protests against racial injustice and police brutality in the United States and around the world.Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo testified on Monday that Chauvin violated training policies by kneeling on Floyd\\'s neck after he had stopped resisting.Further witnesses on Tuesday largely took the same line as they were questioned over Chauvin\\'s actions.Shown a picture of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\\'s neck, Lieutenant Johnny Mercil, the police\\'s use-of force coordinator, said it was not an authorized restraint.\"We tell officers to stay away from the neck when possible. And if you\\'re going to use body weight, to pin it on their shoulder,\" Mercil said during cross-examination.Prosecutors are seeking to prove that Floyd\\'s death was due to asphyxiation, while Chauvin\\'s defense claims it was due to illegal drugs in Floyd\\'s system.Chauvin\\'s lawyer Eric Nelson confirmed he wanted to ask if Hall sold or gave Floyd drugs.Hall\\'s lawyer said \"there\\'s an allegation here that Mr Floyd ingested a controlled substance as police were removing him from the car... This leaves Mr Hall potentially incriminating himself.\"The judge said he would rule later on Hall\\'s request not to testify.Chauvin, who was sacked from the police force after the incident, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and manslaughter.

              " ' India ‘getting the job done’ on climate crisis, says John Kerry  The United States’s special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry on Tuesday praised India for “getting the job done on climate”, calling the country a world leader in renewables as he began talks aimed at cutting carbon emissions amid growing concerns over global warming.Kerry is on a four-day visit to India from April 5 to April 8, during which he will meet representatives from the government, the private sector and NGOs.On Tuesday, Kerry called on India to join hands with the US to confront the climate crisis through a clean energy transition. “Our two nations, world’s two biggest democracies have a great deal to gain by joining hands and global leadership to confront climate change now. We must do this,” Kerry said in his address to the South Asia Women in Energy (SAWIE) Leadership Summit.Earlier in the day, Kerry met Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar for climate talks ahead of US President Biden’s summit on climate, which will be held on April 22-23.“Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with Mr John Kerry. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. We discussed a range of issues including climate finance, joint research and collaboration etc,” Javadekar tweeted after the meeting.In his address to the SAWIE Summit, Kerry said: “I am particularly grateful that India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve, you are indisputably world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership on the International Solar Alliance promises to advance clean energy across India and other dynamic growing economies.”“Decisive action by India will determine what this sustainable transformation will mean for generations to come. India has the opportunity to both elevate women’s empowerment and to avoid the mistakes made by other countries like ours,” he said.According to a senior environment ministry official, one of the key objectives of Kerry’s visit is to get India to join the countries that have announced a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In September 2020, China announced that it will peak its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The White House announced on January 27 that President Biden will take steps to put the US on an “irreversible path” to a net zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations in order to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.“A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country – especially for a lower-middle income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need a number of technologies to become better and cheaper...,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics india united states ',\n",
              " ' India, Russia discuss ways to strengthen strategic ties  India and Russia on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen military and strategic cooperation, including manufacturing of Russian military hardware in the country and the start of talks on creating a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union.These matters figured in the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, the focus of whose visit to New Delhi was preparations for the annual India-Russia Summit to be held in the country later this year.“We talked about the longstanding partnership in nuclear, space and defence sectors... We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks. Lavrov said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “Make in India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives. “In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said. “Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most-affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20.Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said: “We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation.”Did not meet PMLavrov did not have an interaction with the Indian Prime Minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader. The people familiar of the developments sought to play down the matter, saying no such meeting was scheduled as the PM Narendra Modi was away in West Bengal to address public meetings at Cooch Behar and Howrah as part of the BJP’s campaign for the state elections. There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions.Lavrov said the two sides had also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s Far East and the Arctic, he said.Vaccine contractsCollaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted that the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. “For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Make in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Valdimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. “Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing. Russia itself has been concerned about increasing Chinese influence in these areas,” he said.

              " ' Smoke from fires in Uttarakhand worsens Delhi’s air quality  The Capital’s air quality index (AQI) has moved from moderate to poor to very poor over the past four days, the result of raging forest fires from Uttarakhand (and to a lesser extent, Himachal Pradesh) and winds blowing in from the northern state that has lost around 200 acres of forest to fires in the past few days.At 279, Delhi’s air quality was in the “poor” category overall on Tuesday, which according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s Sameer app means “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.”“Delhi’s air quality is on the poor zone as suddenly the dispersal of pollutants has gone down and pollutant load has increased because of many reasons and forest fires is probably one of them,” said Anumita Roy Choudhary, an air quality expert with Centre for Science and Environment.It isn’t just Delhi, several cities in the northern plains are facing the same problem. For example, Sharanpur in Uttar Pradesh recorded AQI of 331 on Tuesday and Yamunanagar in Haryana AQI of 289. And some areas in the foothills of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh witnessed haze like conditions on Tuesday.Uttarakhand has reported close to 100 forest fires in the last 48 hours and close to 250 in the past week. The intensity of forest fires in Himachal is lower, with close to 60 forest fires reported in the last 24 hours.Most of the forest fires are in lower hills, which have pine tree forests that shed highly immflamable needles in this season. As there is no mechanism to collect the needles, a spark can cause fire, said Himachal’s forest minister Rakesh Pathania.What has further contributed to forest fires is the dry hot weather. In the month of March and in first week of April, there was 79% rain deficiency in Uttarakhand and 65% in Himachal Pradesh, according to the India Meteorological Department.A CPCB official, who asked not to be named, said that till the last week of March the wind direction was taking the smoke from forest fires towards the north, thereby not contributing much to the air pollution levels in the plains.According to an Uttarakhand pollution control board official, there has been an increase in pollution levels in even within the state because of the forest fires. “We will be able to provide the data on the increase after few days as raw data was being analysed,” the official said.“There are some forest fires in Uttarakhand, but air quality hasn’t declined in NW India only because of that. Winds are northwesterly here. Air quality is in poor category mainly because of dust and lack of moisture. It will improve later today because a western disturbance is expected to bring rain,” said VK Soni, scientist in IMD’s air quality division.(With inputs from Jayashree Nandi) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics new delhi uttarakhand news ',\n",
              " ' PAU does not practice what it preaches  Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) does not practise what it preaches. While the university experts were seen preaching to farmers about the methods to save water and promoting drip irrigation during an hour-long programme on the final day of the virtual Kisan Mela, the gardeners of the varsity were seen watering its lawns using hose pipes.Interestingly, the two-day virtual mela was based on the theme ‘Aao kheti kharchey ghataiye, vadhu paani, khad na payee; Sahayek dhandey naal apna ke, kheti laheywand banaiyeh (Let us cut farm expenses, reduce the use of water and fertilizers; adopt subsidiary occupations and make farming profitable)’.At a few places in the university, the taps were either broken or water was left running in utter disregard to the depleting groundwater level. The freshwater could be seen going straight into the sewerage or getting accumulated on the ground.The gardening staff appeared to be unaware of the latest techniques of water conservation and were seen watering the gardens using traditional methods.When contacted, estate officer Ashok Kumar said that the matter will be looked into. “Saving water is our top priority. The broken taps and pipes, if any, will be fixed. And wastage of natural resources will not be tolerated,” he added.PAU’s advice to farmers regarding water conservationDuring the virtual Kisan Mela, a panel session on ‘Natural resource management with special reference to water-saving technologies’ was organised wherein experts deliberated on water conservation technologies and shared their experiences. Ajmer Brar, a senior agronomist, was the moderator of the panel discussion.Rakesh Sharda, principal scientist, extension (soil and water engineering) advised the farmers to adopt drip irrigation system, which provides water as per the crop requirement.“It is a water-saving technology and 80% subsidy is being given by the Punjab government for this technique, ‘’ they said.Besides, there are two underground pipeline schemes for individual farmers (50% subsidy) as well as community (90% subsidy), they informed. Experts also suggested sowing of PR 126 rice variety which is early maturing and consumes less water.Besides, they appealed to the farmers to say no to paddy straw burning and instead adopt crop residue management technologies, such as PAU Happy Seeder and Super Seeder for soil health improvement and a pollution-free environment.Jaskarn Singh Mahal, director of extension education, who was the chief guest, said, “Last year, the virtual Kisan Mela was the first virtual mela of India. It has set a fine example in corona times.” He expressed his gratitude to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, officials of the line departments, agricultural and veterinary scientists, farmers, farm women, and the rural youth for their participation in the mela.

All of them were the sole breadwinners of their families. The bodies of three of the victims, Mustkeen, Peechu of Kakowal road and Imitiaz of Kakowal road, were handed over to their kin after post-mortem while authorities are waiting for Sagar’s kin to reach Ludhiana.Mohammad Ehsan, brother of the victim, Mustkeen, said that all three brothers had migrated to Ludhiana just two months ago. “What will I tell Mustkeen’s wife and three children? Life has played such a cruel joke on them,” he said. “While I work in Gurdaspur, my two brothers Mustkeen and Mohammad Akram had been working in Ludhiana. I had asked Akram to find a job for Mustkeen at one place but the contractor took him along to the construction site,” Ehsan added.Mohammad Gulzar, son of the victim Mohammad Khurshid alias Peechu, said he, along with his father and two brothers, had migrated to Ludhiana in the hope of earning a decent living. “But after this tragedy, I don’t want to stay here anymore.

              " ' Maharashtra notifies 269 sq. km. Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary, state’s 50th  The Maharashtra revenue and forest department on Monday notified the Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary, which will be spread over 269 square kilometres in Chandrapur district. This takes the state’s total tally of wildlife sanctuaries to 50. The move comes eight years after the proposal was first tabled in April 2013, with officials attributing the delay largely due to resistance from the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which had large-scale logging operations in the area.The move to notify the area as WLS under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) — which received the chief minister’s assent during a meeting of the state wildlife board in December 2020 — will enhance protection for the area’s tiger population (20 tigers including cubs), and also give legal sanctity to this key wildlife habitat falling in the tiger corridor between Tadoba tiger reserve in Chandrapur and the Kawal wildlife sanctuary in Telangana’s Mancherial district.“The tiger population in Chandrapur has grown considerably over the last 10 odd years, and the area which has now been notified is a known tiger breeding area/ corridor that facilitates dispersal of the population from one protected area to another, between Tadoba and Kawal,” said state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe.The benefits of this move, Rithe said, would not only help to reduce human-tiger conflict in the region (which has seen over 150 human deaths due to tiger conflict in the last 13 years), but will also give an impetus to wildlife tourism and education measures. “There is a chance now to provide gainful employment to members of the local community, but also generate revenue for the state,” Rithe added.Of the 269 sq. kms, which have been notified on April 5, about 18 sq. kms. come under the Central Chanda forest division, while 251 sq. km. comes under the control of the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which will no longer be allowed to harvest timber in the area. Instead, officials said, the state government would compensate the FDCM, which has sought allocation of alternate 250 sq kms of productive forest land. The FDCM has also sought employment for van majdoors as part of the Widlife Sanctuary.The area, which Rithe said is one of the last remaining tracts of primary forest in Maharashtra, boasts a rich biodiversity, including leopards, sloth bears, wild boar, wild dogs, jackals and gaur. “It is all the more important to bring the area under protection because it is a pristine forest. Even though a the forest area has been affected due to commercial forestry and timber extraction by the FDCM,we still have natural old trees and natural forest composition, which you rarely find in other parts of the state,” he said.

The administrator approached the HC after he was named in the FIR after the fire broke out. The administrator informed the court that he had been writing to the BMC and fire brigade about shop owners in the mall not abiding by safety rules but no action was taken which resulted in the fire and hence he should not be held responsible. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale while hearing the petition filed by Sahasrabuddhe through advocate JS Kini was informed that his client was an officer of the court and was appointed as an administrator of Dream Mall by the NCLT in August 2018. Kini submitted that Sahasrabuddhe had been submitting a monthly report to NCLT on implementation of various orders passed by the tribunal from time to time. The bench was informed that after the fire broke out the police registered an FIR on March 26 wherein Sahasrabuddhe has also been named and as he apprehended arrest, he had approached the HC seeking interim protection from arrest and quashing of the FIR. “I am an officer of the court and cannot be expected to run from pillar to post seeking anticipatory bail, hence I have approached the court,” said Kini on behalf of Sahasrabuddhe. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai for the police informed the court that Sahasrabuddhe was not named as an accused in the case and hence had no need to apprehend arrest. However, on instructions from DCP Dhakne, Pai assured the court that the administrator would not be arrested till April 8. After hearing the submissions the court accepted the assurance and issued notice to the civic authorities and the fire brigade and posted hearing on April 8. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Partial lockdown rules upset Maha traders  Calling the state’s order on conducting RT-PCR tests for workers with a 15-day validity impractical, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA) and the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture have approached the government to roll back its decision. In its notification issued on Sunday, the state said all workers have to be vaccinated. It also stated that until they get vaccinated, the workers must carry a valid negative RT-PCR test certificate, which will be valid for 15 days. The rule will come into effect from April 10, the notification stated. The same rule applies to construction workers and e-commerce employees too. Sudhir Mehta, president, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture, on Tuesday said, “Conducting RT-PCR tests every 15 days is completely untenable and will result in chaos. The order will instead delay the test results for those with symptoms. There might be small industries who would not bear the cost and instead ask temporary workers to not come in for a month.” Mehta said the trade body, with close to 3000 members, has also written the state to reverse the decision. Santosh Mandlecha, president of MACCIA, also said the decision is impractical. “The problem is the state is taking decisions without consulting the industry. It is practically impossible to conduct tests every 15 days,” Mandlecha said, adding all trade bodies were going to meet virtually on Tuesday evening, before presenting their demands to the state government.

In a separate order issued on Tuesday, the BMC has also revised the standard operating procedures (SOP) to handle passengers arriving from the UK, Brazil, Europe, South Africa and Middle-East. Passengers arriving from these countries are quarantined in hotels for seven days, however, there have been instances where such passengers go missing from hotels. Hence, the BMC has revised guidelines, making it mandatory for their officers to visit the hotels twice during the stay of a particular passenger and maintain a weekly report of such visits. Chahal said, “Tuesday was the first day of lockdown, and I am sure that if citizens will follow Covid-19 guidelines, cases will start coming down in the city.” Meanwhile, amid the rising need for beds in hospitals in the backdrop of cases increasing in the city, the BMC on Tuesday once again appealed to citizens to call 1916 or ward control room for bed allotment rather than visiting making rounds to every hospital. According to BMC’s dashboard, of the total 17,178 beds, 4,130 beds are vacant. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

They also directed the officials to lodge FIRs against owners and contractors indulging in the practice. Lifting of lintel with jacks is illegal but building owners prefer this over installing a new beam as its saves time and money. “Raising the height of a roof after installing a new beam takes around a month or so but lifting the lintel with jacks takes just around three to four days. The cost is also lower. While installing a new beam costs around ₹450-500 per sq feet, lintel lifting costs around ₹80-100 per sq feet. But the lifting of lintel is an extremely dangerous process and is never recommended by certified architects.”An MC official on the condition of anonymity said, “The illegal practice is prevalent in many parts of the city but it is difficult to keep track of where such activities are taking place as the jacks are kept inside the buildings. In Daba area itself, pamphlets of contractors offering such services can be seen pasted on the walls.” Municipal town planner (MTP) SS Bindra said, “The building where the mishap took place on Monday is about two decades old. The practice of lifting lintel is dangerous and illegal. We have recommended FIRs against building owners and contractors involved in this illegal activity.” Other illegal practicesDuring the site visit on Tuesday, cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sundar Sham Arora are said to have noticed several other anomalies in construction activities in Daba area and recommended action against erring owners.

Sawant was under the impression that there would be a complete lockdown only on Saturdays and Sundays, while on other days, he would have to close by 8pm considering the night curfew in place. “How can we survive with such lockdowns? We could hardly survive last year somehow and any new one means massive losses,” rued Sawant.Similar confusion was witnessed in the adjoining Hindmata market. On being asked to down the shutters, the shop owners reached the Bhoiwada police station, but were told sternly that a mini lockdown was in place and only essential items are allowed.Across the state, traders resorted to sloganeering and protesting against the mini lockdown. The wholesale markets across the states however had announced the closure and many even closed their main shutters.Protests were held across the state at various places like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Satara where traders were seen holding placards and sloganeering against the government.By afternoon, a majority of Mumbai wore a deserted look as shops were closed down and there were hardly any people on the streets. The wholesale markets which are normally full witnessed hardly any citizens.Nirmal Nahar, a cloth wholesaler from the Mangaldas market at Kalbadevi, who says that lockdown has come at the wrong time. “This is a wedding season and even Ramzan festival is arriving next week. This complete closure means total loss for me,” said Nahar. “The problem is if we shut shop, our consumers will buy from Gujarat.”On the streets, the citizens were also worried about the fall out of this mini lockdown. “We faced huge problems during the last lockdown and still we were not able to contain the Covid-19 virus. There are many things one needs apart from medicines and groceries. The government cannot deny us these,” said Mehboob Sayed, a resident of Pydhonie in South Mumbai.The state government’s decision to ensure 50 percent attendance in government offices and allow only companies with financial dealings to function in private officials witnessed a significant drop of commuters in trains and buses. “There was a noticeable dip in train passengers,” said a senior official of the central railways.The bus conductors refused to take standees which resulted in many of the passengers not being taken inside.Rahul Sharma, who travels from Shivaji Park to Byculla for work, said he could not take three buses as all seats were full. “I had to go to Mahim depot to get the bus. It was quite a comfortable travel as usually buses used to be fully packed,” said Sharma.Many running financial institutions also did not come to work as they have been asked to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated fully or else have a RT-PCR negative Covid-19 test result every 15 days. Nitin Nikalje, owner, Gati Investments which deals in stocks and insurance, said it was better to skip work. “How can I force my employees to take the test every 15 days?

              " ' Doctors flag early lung infections as new Covid-19 concern  A couple from south Mumbai in their 60s consulted a doctor last week after having a fever for two days. As the doctor examined them with the help of a stethoscope, he heard what is known as bilateral crackles: typical sounds from the lungs that suggest pneumonia. A Covid-19 test returned positive and a CT scan of the lung confirmed pneumonia. But what surprised the doctor, consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, was the progression of the lung infection. In the past, Covid-19 linked pneumonia was seen after at least 10 days of symptoms, but in this senior couple, pneumonia had set in on the third day.“Involvement of the lung within the second or third day of the onset of symptoms is concerning,” said Dr Samrat Shah, who treated the senior couple. Shah said that their lungs were considerably diseased, and the CT scan severity score was above 7, which meant that they had already crossed the mild stage.As Mumbai grapples with a surge on account of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, doctors across the city say that CT scans of positive patients are revealing faster pulmonary changes even as severity scores are rapidly turning to severe.Given their age, the couple was an ideal candidate for hospitalisation. But they could not find a bed in a private hospital. They were put on intravenous steroids and antiviral medication at home and are now on the road to recovery. According to Dr. Shah, almost 30% of his patients are coming with early lung infections. During the last wave, only some of the immunocompromised patients would turn up with such early infections, he said.Dr Khusrav Bajan, a physician, and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said almost 15% of his Covid-19 patients are suffering from an early lung infection. “Last year, such cases were about 5% to 10%,” said Dr. Bajan, adding that the CT scans of these patients are deteriorating faster, within one or two days of admission.A CT-scan severity score, ranges from 0 to 25; 7 to 12 indicates moderate infection; above 12 indicates a severe infection; below 7 indicates mild infection.“I have so many patients who are slipping from a score of 5 to 20 within a day. They typically have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Also, a peculiar trend is that younger people, under 45 years of age, are coming with such early infections,” said Bajan.From reporting an average of 526 cases per day in January, Mumbai’s daily average rose to 655 cases per day in February and jumped exponentially to 2866 cases per day in March. The surge continues further this month with the city reporting an average of 9500 per day in the first five days. The active cases in the city have jumped by over 700% within a month’s time: from 9055 on March 5 to 73,281 on April 5.According to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard, 12707 patients are currently hospitalised. Of these, 1776 are admitted to intensive care units. Another 1937 patients are admitted in Covid Care Centre (CCC2) that are meant for positive, asymptomatic patients. Around 2% of the total active cases are critical.“Even as the numbers have risen, and more patients are symptomatic, the response rate to therapy is much better. This helps as patients don’t get to the critical state,” said physician Dr. Pratit Samdani who is currently treating one unusual case of a 65-year-old jeweller who developed lung fibrosis on the seventh day of hospitalisation. Lung fibrosis is a severe condition wherein the lung tissues are severely scarred and the damage is irreversible. “We generally see fibrosis after three to four weeks. It is unusual to develop fibrosis so soon,” he said.However, experts also said that the sheer volume of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave has resulted in doctors observing such trends more clearly. “Some patients definitely deteriorate faster. We are also seeing significantly affected lungs in patients but we did see a similar trend last year too,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care physician at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “I think what is concerning right now is the overwhelming number of cases.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' Pandemic effect: Hola Mohalla donations at Anandpur Sahib gurdwaras dip this year again  The donations offered by devotees at Anandpur Sahib gurdwaras during the Hola Mohalla festival dipped further for the second consecutive year as there was a less footfall due to the Covid-19 outbreak this time also. The total donations received this time at Takht Kesgarh Sahib, Kiratpur Sahib and 43 other historic gurdwaras managed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) around the historic town founded by ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur are ₹58 lakh less than the previous year. It was here that his successor Guru Gobind Singh founded the order of Khalsa. The festival celebrations are held for 7 days. Malkeet Singh, manager of Takht Kesgarh Sahib and other historic gurdwaras run by the SGPC, said the heavy rush of devotees was witnessed for only 3 days this time. “Devotees donated ₹2.66 crore this time against the last year’s ₹3.25 crore. Even the last year’s donations were ₹70 lakh less than the preceding year due to the panic created by the pandemic,” he added. “This time, other factors also led to the less footfall. First, the Rupnagar district administration issued a statement that it will be mandatory for the devotees to carry a Covid-19 negative report for participating in the festival. Though the decision was modified later saying it will be applicable only for foreigners, it created confusion among people. Besides, the administration had announced that booths will be set up to conduct on-the-spot Covid-19 tests but nothing was done,” he claimed. The shutdown call given by the farmer unions on March 26 also contributed to a less footfall as many devotees could not come to Anandpur Sahib to participate in the festival which concluded on March 29, Malkeet Singh said.

              " ' Punjab sets up 3,700 mandis for procuring wheat amid Covid surge  The Punjab food and civil supplies department has set up 3,700 mandis for wheat procurement starting from April 10, saying all measures have been taken to ensure compliance with Covid-19 protocols to avoid any rush that can potentially leading to pandemic spread. Of these, nearly half are permanent purchase centres while the rest have been created temporarily. The Punjab Mandi Board, which along with the food and civil supplies department regulates procurement in the state through four agencies, will start issuing passes to farmers from Wednesday (April 7) for bringing their produce to the mandis. Passes to the farmers will be issued 72 hours in advance. Nearly 130 lakh tonne wheat arrival is expected during the procurement season. The government on Monday received ₹21,658 crore from the Reserve Bank of India towards cash credit limit (CCL). But the issue over direct bank transfer (DBT) remains unresolved as the central government is not willing to relent to Punjab’s demand to allow payment to farmers though arhtiyas (commission agents). The Centre has fixed the minimum support price (MSP) of the crop ₹1.975 per quintal, hiking it by ₹50 from the last year’s ₹1,925. On Wednesday, the board is likely to issue 40,000 passes to the farmers to bring produce in a staggered manner. On Tuesday, produce started arriving in the mandis at Patran, Patiala, Sangrur, Mansa, Fatehgarh Sahib besides some parts of Bathinda, Samrala and Khanna. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is expected to meet Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday to discuss the DBT issue seeking an extension of its implementation. Also, he will take up issues of rural development fund, movement of food stocks from the state godowns and release of pending incidentals. BJP questions state govt’s sincerity The BJP’s Punjab unit on Tuesday said the Amarinder Singh-led government in the state was playing “politics of deception” by scuttling Centre’s DBT scheme for state farmers. State general secretary Subhash Sharma said at the insistence of farmer organisations the then state government had agreed to implement the scheme in 2013 and submitted an affidavit in the Punjab and Haryana High Court assuring that suitable provisions would be made in the agriculture marketing rules. “The state government and the Centre signed pact in February to integrate an online payment system and agreed to make amendments to the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets (General) Rules for transfer of funds to farmers directly.

              " ' In SAD’s Ludhiana publicity blitz, Sr Badal is conspicuously missing  Ludhiana Even as the elections are still a year away, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has already swung into poll mode. Besides, announcing five Vidhan Sabha candidates in the state, the party has launched a publicity campaign in Ludhiana through hoardings and billboards, but the face of party’s patriarch Parkash Singh Badal is conspicuously missing. The billboards, however, carry pictures of almost all top leaders, including party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Bikram Singh Majithia, YAD president Parambans Singh Romana and Sharanjit Singh Dhillon. Party’s district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon distanced himself from the faux pas. “First the hoardings were installed by the Youth Akali Dal and not by SAD. I strongly believe that it (missing Senior Badal) was unintentional. Parkash Singh Badal is and will always remain the face of the party,” he said. In the hoardings, some YAD leaders have been congratulated for being appointed office-bearers. District (urban) president Gurdeep Singh Gosha said, “Parkash Singh Badal has spent his entire life in the service of the people of Punjab. He is inseparable from the party. It is an inadvertent mistake at printer’s end. In a day or two, new hoardings will be installed.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The move came more than a week after the Supreme Court directed the Punjab government to hand over the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA to UP authorities within a fortnight. The Mau legislator was taken in an ambulance to the Banda jail under heavy security at 2 pm. The 8-vehicle cavalcade also included a Vajra van. Earlier, a team of doctors conducted medical tests of Ansari, who has been in the Rupnagar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion FIR registered by a Mohali-based builder. The UP cops led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Satya Prakash reached Rupnagar at 4:30am and remained in the central jail for two hours to complete the formalities. The Yogi Adityanath-led government in UP had moved the apex court seeking the custody of Ansari, wanted in several criminal cases in the state, after the Punjab government refused to shift him. Inquiry ordered into abandoned ambulanceRupnagar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Akhil Chaudhary ordered a probe into the circumstances under which an ambulance (UP-41-AT-7171) that ferried Ansari from the central jail to a Mohali court on March 31 was found abandoned near a dhaba. As an FIR of fake registration was registered in Barabanki, a police headed by a DSP had reached Rupnagar to probe the case. The team found that the vehicle was not bullet proof and its chassis number was also the same as registered in UP. “Our technical team will inspect the vehicle once we reach UP,” DSP Naveen Kumar, who led the team from Barabanki, said.

The high court acted on the plea of Mahinder Kaur and one more, who had contended before court that the April 1 guidelines of urban local bodies department lay down that the selection of the president is to be made as per the reservation and out of the winning members of the ward concerned of that category would be violative of the Article 243-T of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has already opined that wherever office of the president of a municipality is required to be filled in by a member belonging to a Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or backward class as the case may be, it would be enough if one belongs to one of those categories irrespective of the fact whether they have been elected from a general ward or a reserved ward, the court was told about interpretation rendered by SC of the Article 243-T. A total of three backward class candidates have won from non-reserved wards but if state’s imposed condition is followed, these three candidates will be deprived of the chance to become the president. And if only one candidate is allowed to contest for the post of president, then no-confidence motion can never be moved against him as there would be no competition, thus defeating the purpose. The Kotkapura municipal council has 29 wards of which 10 were reserved. Only one candidate has won on the reserved category seat, as per the plea. The case will be taken up again on Wednesday.

Gurmej Singh, 45, of Jamalpura village was shot dead by unidentified assailants in June 2019. Those arrested have been identified as Jashanpreet Singh, alias Jashan, of Noordi village and Arshdeep Singh, alias Arsh, of Tarn Taran. Police said Jashan, who had been stalking the victim’s daughter, hatched a conspiracy to commit the crime with the help of Arsh and one Amritpal Singh of Bachre village.

He was arrested by NIA on March 13 for allegedly planting an SUV with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threating letter near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia in February. Hiran is linked to the SUV.“The agency wanted to verify certain details with all the people concerned in the case who were present at the CIU office when Hiran had met Vaze. The agency will verify details and examine the facts,” said an NIA official.However, a senior Mumbai Police officer clarified that the DCP in question had visited the CIU office for some other work and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.As of now, NIA has recorded the statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in the Antilia explosives scare as well as Hiran’s death case, added the NIA officer.On Monday at 11.40pm, a group of eight to 10 NIA officers – while recreating the crime scene in the Hiran death case – took Vaze to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) after they discovered during investigation that the suspended cop had taken a train from there to Kalwa station on March 4, the day Hiran went missing. A team from Pune’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CSFL) was also present at the time of crime scene recreation, and they recorded a video of Vaze walking on platform number 4, from where he had boarded a train around 7pm on March 4.Hiran was allegedly murdered on March 4 and his body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) was investigating the Hiran murder case, before it was handed over to NIA.ATS officers during their probe had found that Vaze had got off at Kalwa railway station and had allegedly contacted Hiran around 8.29pm. They spoke for around 11 minutes and Vaze allegedly asked him to meet near Ghodbunder Road. However, he requested Hiran to tell his family that he was going to meet an officer named Tawade from Kandivli police station. Vaze allegedly called Hiran from a mobile number provided by another arrested accused Naresh Gor. He also did not use his mobile phone to make the call. The phone used to call Hiran was later destroyed, said NIA.On Monday night, the officials also took Vaze to Kalwa railway station by road, where he was made to walk from the platform to the station’s exit, said the NIA officer. The agency has also taken custody of the CCTV footage of CSMT and Kalwa station, added the officer.NIA had seized a high-end bike in the case from Daman on Monday. It is registered at Thane in the name of a woman, suspected to be known to Vaze, said NIA.

              " ' Wheat procurement: Uncertainty over mode of payment haunts farmers  Even as wheat procurement is slated to start in Punjab on April 10, uncertainty continues to loom large around the process on the ground.Field officials engaged in the massive procurement exercise said on Tuesday that elaborate arrangements are being made across the state for the smooth purchase, but there is still no official word on the mode of payment to farmers.Officials familiar with the development say though the Punjab government has been stating that payments will be done through arhtiyas, quoting Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) rules, but explicit details in this regard are still awaited.“We understand that arhtiyas will stay in the picture for wheat procurement as directions have been issued by the state authorities that the farmers will be allowed to come to grain markets and other procurement centres on basis of coupons issued through the commission agents,” said a district official. For the second consecutive year, wheat will be procured in a staggered manner to avoid mass gatherings in view of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) in March had asked the state government for the land records of farmers to enable direct, online payment of minimum support price (MSP). The payment is routed through arhtiyas or commission agents under current practice.People familiar with the development say according to a nine-page communication of the food and civil supplies department dated Apri 1, payment for wheat purchase will be done online through Punjab government’s “anaaj kharid portal”.“We are yet to get the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the online payment. The state authorities have directed the mandi board to make all arrangements to purchase each foodgrain in mandis. All purchase agencies are working in tandem for procurement,” said the district mandi officer of Bathinda Preet Kanwar Singh Brar.Punjab is expected to produce 130 lakh MT and FCI is scheduled to buy 20% or 26 lakh MT. Rest stock will be bought by four state agencies where Pungrain will buy 29.9 lakh MT followed by Markfed and Punsup at 28.60 lakh MT each. Punjab warehouse is slated to procure 16.9 lakh MT.Bathinda, the largest district of southern Punjab is expected to procure 10.31 lakh metric tonne wheat, a marginal increase of 31,000 MT than the previous season.Besides 182 conventional mandis, additional 150 sites will be used for purchase in a phased manner.Fazilka district food and supplies controller (DFSC) Gurpreet Kang said a shortage of bags will be overcome before the mass arrival of rabi crop in the next few days as bulk supplies of gunny and plastic bags are underway.“There are no serious space constraints and the old stock is continuously transported by different agencies. For this year, FCI has ensured to provide ample storage space,” said Kang.Mansa district mandi officer Rajnish Goel said a farmer will be entitled to sell 50 quintals of produce“From today we started Covid-19 vaccination for all those eligible persons engaged in procurement including, arthiyas, loaders, mandi board officials and farmers,” he said.

              " ' Allegations against Anil Deshmukh: CBI team reaches Mumbai, begins probe  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary inquiry based on the Bombay high court (HC) order on the petition filed by lawyer Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil. In her petitions, Patil had sought directions to Malabar Hill police station to take cognisance of her letter, which sought an inquiry into the allegations by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. According to CBI sources, a team comprising six officers reached Mumbai from Delhi on Tuesday. The half-a-dozen officers will probe the allegations and it involves examining several persons including Mumbai Police officers, hotel owners, restaurants etc, said an officer who didn’t want to be named. Officials cited above said they will examine Singh, who had levelled serious allegations against Deshmukh in a letter written to state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, days after he was shunted out to a low key post in the department. The agency will also record Patil’s statement. They added Deshmukh is also likely to be examined in the later. HC on Monday, in its 52-page judgment, had directed CBI to conclude the preliminary probe within 15 days. The court had observed that Malabar Hill police had failed to take action on Patil’s complaint, which had pointed to a “cognisable offence” being committed by Deshmukh. HC noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law, and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.” It further observed that as the state police force was under Deshmukh [he resigned after HC’s directions for probe], it would serve the ends of justice if a preliminary probe was conducted by an independent agency such as CBI. “Deshmukh is home minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like CBI,” noted the bench in its judgment on Monday. “The allegations made by Shri Param Bir Singh are serious in nature and against the highest functionary of the government of Maharashtra, when it comes to the functioning of the police department. Prima facie, the issues are such that the very faith of citizens in the functioning of the police department is at stake. If there is any amount of truth in such allegations, certainly it has a direct effect on the citizens’ confidence in the police machinery in the state. Such allegations, therefore, cannot remain unattended and are required to be looked into in the manner known to law when prima facie they indicate commission of a cognisable offence. It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of the state machinery, which would stare at the face when confronted with the expectations of the law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials,” the court observed.

              " ' 1 more Maharashtra min will resign in 8 days: State BJP chief  High on morale, after two Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers’ resignation in the past 35 days, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to up the ante against the state government. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Tuesday said that one more MVA minister will resign in the next eight days.Speaking at Pune on the occasion of BJP’s 41st foundation day, Patil said there are at least seven ministers with serious criminal offences in MVA government.“There are six-seven ministers in the state cabinet who are facing serious criminal charges. One of the ministers is facing imprisonment for assaulting a policeman, while another has recently revealed his relationship outside wedlock. One minister’s son-in-law is in jail in connection with a drug case, while another is facing charges of beating a party worker. We are not interested in taking the resignation of any minister, but it is going to happen naturally. Like in cricket, the first few batsmen bat for a longer time, but the tail-enders fall quickly. Similarly, the next resignations from MVA ministers will come at shorter intervals,” he said, adding that while the list of wrongdoings of some MVA ministers has already been in the public domain, a few more names will be added to it in the next few days.“The MVA government will collapse under its own deeds. There is no need to put in special efforts to topple it. BJP will fight the elections on its own and form the government without joining hands with any other party,” Patil said.According to BJP leaders, the state unit has decided to go become more aggressive against MVA government over the issues of corruption and lockdown. “We have no specific strategy to topple the [Uddhav] Thackeray government as it would not benefit us in any given way. Even immediate elections would not help us in winning the seats required to form the government. As such, our aim is to taint the ruling parties as much as possible and create negative public sentiments against them. For that, we have been capitalising every given opportunity, which keep coming without any great effort,” said a BJP leader, requesting anonymity.On Monday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had also said that more names will come to light for their involvement in the “extortion” case during the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) probe. “There are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation. The alleged involvement of the [former] home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavyweights from the ruling parties are involved in the entire case of extortion,” he said.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary Sachin Sawant said that the claims by BJP leaders are out of the helplessness and grid for power. “They are talking about the charges faced by our ministers but what did they do about their ministers who faced even more serious charges? CBI had lodged an FIR (first information report) against Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar (labour minister in the Fadnavis government), despite which he was made a minister. Many other ministers from their cabinet faced serious charges, but were clean chits. There is no substance in what Patil is saying,” said Sawant. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

CII Punjab chairman Bhavdeep Sardana and vice-chairman Amit Thapar, who met Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar, chief secretary Vini Mahajan and other top officials of state government here on Tuesday, said the gap analysis will look at the existing industry and the type of industry required along with the infrastructure requirement. “It will also study the available infrastructure, what is needed and the gap. We will take inputs of sectoral experts from the industry having first-hand experience. They can give their customised inputs and practical solutions, telling us about policy changes and rail or road linkages, landing sites and other facilities are needed to give a push to industrial infrastructure in the state. This will be done jointly with the government,” the newly elected state head of CII, one of the largest industry bodies in the country, said, listing robust infrastructure, better freight connectivity, ease of doing business and capacity building initiatives among priorities. At the meeting, the state government also sought CII’s help to reach out to homegrown entrepreneurs and encourage them to invest more in the state, particularly in industrial parks, cycle valley and pharmaceutical cluster, according to the industry body. CII also agreed to set up focused sectoral sub-groups of its prominent members which would work with the state government. The meeting was the first between CII’s new team and the state’s bureaucratic top brass. The state industry had faced a double whammy during the year gone by – first ravaged by the coronavirus-induced six-week long national lockdown, and then the farmers’ agitation, particularly the two-month rail roko, that brought the movement of raw material and manufactured goods in and out of the state to a halt. ‘INDUSTRY HAS BOUNCED BACK, CREDIT OFF-TAKE UP’ Sardana said the industry has bounced back from the impact of Covid-19 and the protest related disruptions. He said production capacities are getting expanded and fresh investments being made with credit off-take also showing up. “The industry suffered losses and its patience was tested, but it was a temporary phase and the state government was supportive. We support farmers and want these issues to be resolved amicably,” he said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Our aim is to create transparent police force: New Maharashtra home min  Maharashtra’s new home minister Dilip Walse Patil, who assumed the charge on Tuesday, has plenty of challenges before him to ensure the ‘cleansing’ of the police force from the current mess. The minister, on day one of his new role, has hinted at transparency in administrative dealing and ‘zero political interference’ in police force. Experts in the police force and the home department feel that if the home minister walked the talk, the task will be half completed. Soon after taking the charge, Walse Patil said there would be no political interference in the police administration. “The general public, especially the women, keep a lot of hope from the police force. Our aim is to make the force public centric and maintain maximum transparency in administration.” When asked about the groupism and factionalism within the police force, the minister said, “I am yet to hold meetings with senior police and home department officers. I am yet to take stock of the situation. The police force should work unitedly without any infighting. We will attempt to put things in place.” Walse Patil is taking charge at a time when the partners of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government were caught unaware by the Bombay high court’s Monday ruling, forcing the alliance to drop Anil Deshmukh as the home minister. The resignation came on the heels of two serious allegations of ‘forced extortion’ and corruption in police transfers. Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had alleged that Deshmukh had asked crime branch officers to collect ₹100 every month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. Another IPS (Indian Police Service) officer and former intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla had submitted a report last August to the state government over the alleged exchange of money for police transfers. Taking the cognisance of Singh’s allegations, HC had ordered a preliminary inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Deshmukh. “The image of not only Mumbai and Maharashtra Police, but also that of the government has maligned. The corruption in the police force or by politicians is a known fact, but their open endorsement [for corruption] affects the public sentiment a lot. It seems that the new home minister knows where it has hurt the most and hence, spoke about transparency, zero interference and people-centric police force. The indiscipline, groupism and sycophancy in the force need to be dealt with iron hands, and at times with a pinch of sacrifice of power and gains,” said an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer from the government. Officials from the home department also pointed out at the undesired political interference in police postings and transfers, which take a toll on discipline and lead to more corruption. “The Supreme Court directives given in 2006 in the Prakash Singh case are blatantly violated while appointing senior officers. The recommendations by the Police Establishment Boards are overruled without just reasons. This not only leads to the discontent among meritorious police officers, but also gives encouragement to malpractices intended towards wooing the political bosses. I have worked with the then home minister RR Patil, who would respect the views of the officials, and at times would have courage to justify the decision on record while overruling our recommendations,” said a retired IAS officer, requesting anonymity. Walse Patil said transfers will take place as per the set system. “There is system in place at various levels for the transfers of various posts in the police force. The decision about the postings and transfers would be taken accordingly,” he said. Retired IPS officer Sudhakar Suradkar said the biggest challenge before the new home minister would be to control and reduce political interference and give a free hand to the police force. “Also, high-ranking police officers should respect their own powers, without bowing before their political bosses. I firmly believe that an uncontrolled police personnel inclines towards criminal act and should be controlled by their bosses, court and by public sentiments.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

He has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, demanding changes in the lockdown norms.Fadnavis has also pointed at the discrepancies in lockdown norms. “You have allowed the transportation to operate, but related businesses such as spare parts shops and garages have been shut. There are many such examples that have emerged out of the [state’s] notification issued. It has led to discontent among people, leading to the protests in many parts of the state. The decision of restrictions on small shopkeepers, hoteliers and salons needs to be tweaked immediately by issuing a revised order,” he wrote.Fadnavis also said that Thackeray, during their conversation ahead of imposing the stricter curbs, had spoken about only a two-day lockdown. “But the type of curbs that have been imposed, it appears to be an undeclared month-long lockdown,” said Fadnavis.

              " ' New order lists J&K DDC chiefs above MPs  The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Tuesday issued a revised warrant of precedence, placing the status of chiefs of the district development councils (DDCs) on par with those of the mayors of the Jammu and Srinagar MCs.The order, which was issued by the Hospitality and Protocol Department, came nearly a month after the newly-elected DDC members staged a protest over the issue of protocol and monthly honorarium. The latest warrant of precedence also places DDC members above Members of Parliament in terms of precedence. Besides this, the order also put ”District Magistrates, Officers of the rank of Brigadiers and equivalent, Major Heads of Department, Conservator of Forests, District & Session Judges, Chairpersons, Block Development Councils, Presidents of Municipal Councils and Municipalities under the same protocol.” In the maiden DDC polls in the UT, Farooq Abdullah-led People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) won 110 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party by securing 75 seats. On March 9, the newly-elected DDC members, irrespective of their parties, boycotted a two-day programme and staged a protest against a government order on their honorarium and protocol here. “This is our insult and humiliation,” Shabir Ahmad Lone, DDC member from Rafiabad, said then. The protest was, however, called off a day later following an assurance by Lt Governor Sinha to address the issue. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

A division bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia passed these orders on a writ petition challenging the penalty order passed by the director. The petitioner has alleged that he has been mala fide involved in a fictitious case and even in the departmental inquiry initiated against him, no proper opportunity was afforded to him and no rules or principles of natural justice were followed. The court observed that the record reveals that even the employer — the director of agriculture — had come to a firm conclusion that the petitioner had misappropriated ₹26.69 lakh of the sale proceeds and had not deposited this amount in the government treasury, yet he, instead of imposing major penalty on the petitioner, only imposed a minor penalty of ‘censure’. The court said it has failed to understand and appreciate as to what was the source of power or authority of the director of agriculture to pass an order of censure. The court directed the respondent state to file reply within a period of four weeks and posted the matter for May 18. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

After HC rap, Panjab University announces senate poll schedule The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 are nominated by the university chancellor, two are nominated from the Punjab assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected.The four-year term of the previous senate had ended on October 31, 2020. While the elections were scheduled in August last year, these were postponed twice by V-C Raj Kumar due to the pandemic.According to the revised dates finalised by PU, the election for the constituencies of principals of technical and professional colleges and the staff of technical and professional colleges will be held on May 3.The polling for the constituencies of professors and associate/ assistant professors of the university teaching departments is scheduled on May 10, while the constituency of heads of affiliated arts colleges will go to polls on May 16. Also, election for the constituency of associate professors/ assistant professors of affiliated arts colleges will take place on May 16.As per the election schedule, polling for the registered graduate constituency, which is the largest among the constituencies of the PU senate, will be held on May 16. The registered graduate constituency has 3,61,879 eligible voters for which polling booths are set up in different states apart from Chandigarh and Punjab.Former senator Navdeep Goyal, who is contesting from faculties, said, “This is a positive step taken by the university in the wake of the high court ruling. The governing body should be in place for the smooth functioning of the university.”Last week, hearing the plea of seven former senators who had moved the high court on December 22 seeking directions to PU to hold the senate polls, the bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh had observed that provisions on governance have been thrown “off to the winds” and the university is being run as a “one-man show”. “No doubt the V-C is empowered to postpone the elections for the time being, but this does not clothe him with unbridled powers to carry on indefinitely when throughout the country elections are being held,” the bench added.PU had earlier written to six states for permission to set up polling booths for the conduct of senate polls. However, only Punjab and Delhi have given permission so far. PU’s official spokesperson Renuka Salwan said, “The other states have been intimated about the directions of the high court for the conduct of senate polls.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Polling for 404 seats in south ends, high voter turnout  Chennai/Thiruvanthapuram Marking the end of the election cycle, the single-phased polls across 404 seats in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday concluded peacefully even as few incidents of clashes and complaints against candidates were reported from some areas. The electoral process, which was held from 7 am to 7 pm, registered a high voter turnout as officials ensured strict security and adherence to Covid-19 protocols. Those arriving at poll stations were provided hand sanitisers to clean their hands and a disposable glove. Some people who arrived without masks were asked to wear one to be able to vote. In Tamil Nadu, a voter turnout of 71.79 per cent was recorded as polling in 234 seats was conducted at a brisk pace across the state. On Tuesday, the state held its first assembly election after the death of two Dravidian stalwarts and former chief ministers M Karunanidhi of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and J Jayalalithaa of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The DMK-led alliance is looking to unseat the AIADMK government after being out of power for 10 years.Chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami, accompanied by his grandson, cast his vote at Siluvampalayam in his native Salem district and urged all people to do the same. “I request (all) to perform our democratic duty,” he told reporters.Celebrities like Rajinikanth was among the early voters while top actor Vijay rode a bicycle to the polling booth leading to speculation by social media users who asked if it was a subtle ‘sign’ of opposition to rise in fuel prices. His publicist, however, clarified that he cycled as the booth was nearby and he didn’t want to create any parking issues. After visiting a poll booth in Coimbatore, Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) chief ministerial candidate Haasan alleged cash distribution and submitted a complaint in this regard. “There is widespread cash distribution. They are giving tokens for it to be exchanged for cash. I got these reports,” he told reporters. Chief electoral officer (CEO) Satyabrata Sahoo sought a report from Chennai district election officer on an AIADMK complaint against DMK chief M K Stalin’s son and Chepauk-Tiruvallikeni candidate Udhayanidhi for sporting the party flag and rising sun symbol on his white shirt. Similarly, the DMK complained against BJP Thousand Lights candidate Khushboo Sundar for coming to the polling station in a car bearing the party flag. DMK candidate for Thondamuthur assembly segment, Karthikeya Shivesenapathy lodged a complaint alleging that he was mobbed by some AIADMK workers, when he was proceeding to a polling station. A minor clash ensued between workers of the two parties which was quickly resolved by local police. Stone pelting was reported in Theni district from where deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is contesting. His son and Lok Sabha MP O P Ravindranath’s car was reportedly damaged, prompting additional forces to take position in the area. CEO Sahoo, meanwhile, dismissed reports that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) at a polling station in Virudhunagar displayed only a particular symbol regardless of whichever candidate they selected. Only the symbol that was chosen gets recorded in the EVM and the same was corroborated in the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail units, he said.The officer also brushed aside reports that one or two poll officials died during duty.Voters who had tested positive for Covid-19 were allowed to cast their ballot during the last hour of polling (6 pm to 7 pm) and were provided with PPE kits, officials said. DMK MP Kanimozhi, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, arrived at her polling booth in an ambulance during this period to cast her vote. Kerala, which is witnessing a fierce fight between the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), registered heavy polling with 73.58 per cent of the total 2.4 crore voters casting their franchise in 140 seats. Despite the scorching heat and sporadic rain in many parts, people stood in long queues to take part in the electoral process. Three senior citizens, waiting to cast their vote in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts, collapsed and died, officials said.Constituencies in northern Kannur, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Thirssur were among those districts which recorded comparatively higher polling percentage while southern districts like Pathanamthitta and Idukki reported lower percentage, according to people familiar with the developments.Barring a few complaints of bogus voting and altercation between rival party workers, polling turned out to be peaceful in the state where the LDF is attempting to buck the trend of political parties swapping power every five years to return for a historic second consecutive term by beating the UDF. A traditional third in the state’s bipolar politics, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance has also made some swift moves to stay afloat, including naming Metro Man E Sreedharan as its chief ministerial candidate. “The BJP will have an impressive show this time. There’s no doubt about it. I will win from the Palakkad constituency with a big margin. My entry into the BJP has given a different image to the party,” Sreedharan, who is contesting from Palakkad constituency, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI after casting his vote. Senior Congress leader AK Antony believed that the UDF will make a strong comeback. “For the last few days, an anti-government wave is sweeping all over the state. The voters of Kerala will throw LDF out of power. The UDF will come back with thunder. The Congress-led UDF government will be formed in Kerala strengthening Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in their fight against anti-people policies of the Centre,” he told reporters after casting his vote in the state capital. In Taliparambha in north Kerala, the UDF sought re-polling in several stations, alleging booth capturing and bogus voting. In Kazhakootam (Thiruvananthapuram), a violent clash between Communist Party of India (Marxist) and BJP workers left five persons injured from both camps. The ruling party workers also allegedly manhandled Abdul Rasheed, the UDF’s candidate from Adoor.A presiding officer in Payyanur constituency in Kerala’s Kannur was hospitalised after he was allegedly attacked by CPI(M) activists for reportedly preventing a man from voting without an identity document. Voting was stopped for half an hour and another officer was appointed to replace him. In a month-long campaign, political parties have clashed on contentious issues, including allegations of gold smuggling against some officials in the chief minister’s office and the controversy around the entry of all women in to the Sabarimala Temple. The temple issue, however, returned on polling day after G Sukumaran Nair, general secretary of the Nair Service Society, a socio-educational body of the upper caste Nairs, said devotees were yet to get justice and this would reflect in the assembly results. “The NSS general secretary and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala gave an impression that the election was a battle between believers and non-believers. Invoking religious issues is against the poll code of conduct,” state law minister A K Balan said in his complaint to the chief electoral officer. For the 30-member Puducherry assembly,81.64 per cent of 1,004,507 electors exercised their franchise to decide the fate of 324 candidates. The Union Territory slipped into a political crisis shortly before the elections were announced, when the Congress-led government fell due to defections.Yanam, where the AINRC leader N Rangasamy is contesting, registered a higher percentage of polling than the other three regions from the beginning. Rangasamy is seeking election to the territorial Assembly from Thattanchavady segment in Puducherry region also.The contest here is keen between the AINRC-led NDA and the Congress-led Secular Democratic alliance.There was tight security across all booths and polling remained peaceful throughout the day.Several leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged voters to cast their votes. Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh also appealed to voters in the four states and one Union Territory to exercise their franchise in record numbers.

We can’t see even 10% of the steps taken during the first 30 days of the pandemic. Apart from there is no consolation or any attempt to take the experts and the Opposition into confidence over the steps taken by the government to fight the pandemic.

A BJP leader, who didn’t want to be named, said that Yediyurappa’s indecisiveness is putting the state government in a difficult position. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading the country by example during the pandemic, but here in our state, the leader is confused. Taking a U-turn has become a trend for the state government. This needs to be changed,” he said. The BS Yediyurappa-led government since the start of the Covid-19 induced national lockdown last year, has reversed its orders quite a number of times, drawing flak from different quarters. On May 3, 2020, during the peak of the nationwide lockdown, the Karnataka government started facilitating Sharmik trains to ferry migrant workers to various states. Just three days later, the BS Yediyurappa-led government decided to stop these trains and within two days reversed this decision. Close to a year later, as the state witnesses a second wave of infections, the government on Sunday decided to reduce the occupancy of movie theatres to 50 % and close down gyms in the state as a preventive measure. But this decision was reversed within a day. These are several such instances when the state government did flip-flops on key decisions on Covid-19 prevention. Yediyurappa’s indecisiveness has been a matter of discussion since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. In April 2020, during the lockdown, the government first allowed the movement of two-wheelers and the opening up of the Information Technology (IT) offices with one-third of the workforce. But on April 19, just a day before this decision was to be implemented, the order was rolled back. Within few days, on May 1, 2020, Yediyurappa announced that migrant labourers would have to pay for buses ferrying them. Even this decision was reversed on May 2, 2020, after objections were raised by activists, claiming the bus operators are charging exorbitant fares. Then came the decision to stop the Sharmik trains for migrant workers after a meeting with a real estate delegation on May 6. “The government allegedly told that letting migrants go home would severely hamper developmental, construction and other industrial activities. But when media started showing stories about the migrant workers walking back home since there were no trains, he reversed the decision within two days,” said Vinay Srinivasa, a Bengaluru-based lawyer and activist. The other decision that he reversed were stopping the supply of free food to daily wage workers in government-run Indira Canteens. This decision was pulled back within 24 hours of its announcement on March 23, 2020. Another section of the saffron party, however, argued that this shows that the government believes in course correction based on expert opinion. Defending the chief minister, revenue minister R Ashok said that the situation in the state is changing constantly and the chief minister is taking decisions that would ensure people’s safety and economic activities. “This simply shows that the chief minister is willing to listen to both the health experts and the industry, act without any ego,” he said.

              " ' Night curfew back in Chandigarh  Amid a steep surge in Covid-19 cases, the Chandigarh administration on Tuesday decided to enforce night curfew in the city from 10pm to 5am. Formal orders will be issued on Wednesday and will come into effect immediately.During the curfew hours, no gatherings, parties or non-essential activities will be allowed. Even restaurants will be required to close by 10pm.Stricter measures like weekend curfew and closure of apni mandis and other crowded places will also be considered, unless people start abiding by the guidelines for Covid appropriate behaviour, said UT administrator VP Singh Badnore while chairing a review meeting where the decision was taken. He also directed police to ensure strict implementation of the night curfew. The curfew will be reviewed in case the situation improves.The move comes on the day the Centre raised concern over the pandemic situation in Chandigarh.The UT again recorded 300+ cases on Tuesday, with 319 people testing positive. Two deaths were also reported. While more than 1,700 cases have been added to the tally within six days this month, the number of active cases has bumped up to 3,037, among the highest since the outbreak last March. Though 25,375 of the 28,798 people tested positive so far have been cured and discharged, recovery rate has dropped to 88%. On February 13, when the UT had lowest number of active cases (123) this year, recovery rate was 97.7%.‘Big jump in cases for a small UT’Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, during a media briefing in New Delhi on Tuesday, flagged Chandigarh as the only area of concern among small states and union territories. Bhushan said that Chandigarh is a small UT in terms of population as well as area, but Covid-19 cases being reported daily have gone up from less than 20 on an average to 287, while average deaths have remained between 1 to 3.While noting that positivity rate has climbed to 14%, the health secretary appreciated the fact that the share of RT-PCR tests as compared to the lesser reliable antigen tests has increased to 81%.Even on March 24, the Union health ministry had listed Chandigarh among eight states and UTs that have led to an exponential increase in the number of active cases in the country.In response to this, the Centre had deputed a three-member team in the city to assist the local administration. It has observed that contact tracing and vaccination coverage need to be improved, though no formal report has been submitted yet.Get tested, vaccinated: BadnoreDuring the review meeting, Badnore expressed serious concern over the rising numbers. He appealed to market associations to ensure that their employees are tested and vaccinated, as provisions for both are available at government centres for free.He also directed hospitals to ensure that all health workers get themselves vaccinated at the earliest, as the administration is considering withdrawal of priority to frontline workers soon. Coverage stands at 54% and 60% among healthcare and other frontline workers, respectively. While urging eligible citizens to get vaccinated, he directed all to avoid non-essential travel outside the city, keeping in view the high rate of infection spread all over the country.Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director principal, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, informed Badnore that many patients from Punjab and Haryana who can be easily treated in their district hospitals are unnecessarily travelling to Chandigarh and crowding the hospital beds. She said Sood Dharamshala in Sector 22 will be opened on Wednesday to take care of mild Covid cases. Municipal commissioner KK Yadav said 52 teams have been constituted to conduct sanitation operations across the city and MC teams are tracing on an average 15 contacts of each positive case. The central team had recently told the UT to increase this number of 25-30. 28 new micro-containment zones, total reaches 75 The Chandigarh administration on Tuesday declared 28 more micro-containment zones in the city. With this, the total has increased to 75 within a month, said Arun Gupta, UT home secretary, during the Covid-19 review meeting. Deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said the affected areas were identified by a committee on the basis of the number of cases being reported from there. While three micro-containment zones have been declared in Sectors 28 and 30, there are two each in Sectors 22, 27, 41 and 44 besides Manimajra (Pipliwala Town and Uppal Apartments). Others are spread across Sectors 10, 11, 19, 20, 46, 48 and 63 besides Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Kishangarh, Mauli Jagran and Dhanas.Brar said regular screening and monitoring of the areas will continue and frequent sanitisation will be conducted.

              " ' HC seeks vigilance response on plea alleging scam in medicine purchase  The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has sought response from the Haryana vigilance bureau and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a plea alleging scam in the purchase of medicine in Haryana.The plea by Hisar resident Jagwinder Singh Kulharia alleges instances of serious offences of the institutionalised form of corruption in the purchase of medicines and medical equipment in at least nine districts in Haryana.It estimates the scam at ₹300 crore and further alleges that the purchases were made from the firms, which were running out of fake addresses. The petition was listed before a single judge bench in February, which forwarded the matter to the chief justice in view of larger public interest involved.On Tuesday, the HC bench of chief justice RS Jha issued notice of motion in the matter in which the vigilance department and ED have been arrayed as parties.The petitioner is a retired deputy superintendent from the health department and claims that he had a “deep knowledge of corruption and money laundering happening in the sale-purchase of medicines and equipment.”The petitioner, through the RTIs, obtained documents on the basis of which he requested the vigilance bureau to register FIRs.However, the department, rather than registering the FIR, disclosed his name and contents of information to the officers who are potential accused in the scam, culminating into the victimisation and threats to the petitioner, the plea alleges before HC seeking probe by the ED.

              " ' E-commerce giant to set up fulfilment centre in Haryana’s Manesar, to be one of its largest centres in Asia  The Haryana government accorded approval to allot 140-acre land to online shopping platform, Flipkart, for setting up what will be one of its largest centres in Asia at Patli Hajipur in Manesar spread across three million square feet covered area.The approval was granted in a meeting of the Haryana Enterprise Promotion Board (HEPB), held under the chairmanship of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, in Chandigarh on Tuesday. Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, who holds the industry department portfolio, was also present.An official spokesperson said that the HEPB granted approval in view of the increasing demand of warehousing from e-commerce companies.According to the state government, the land allotted at ₹3.22 crore per acre to Instakart Services Private Limited, a Flipkart Group company, will give impetus to further investments in the region and boost market access opportunities.“Representatives of Flipkart Group said that Instakart is planning to set up a series of fulfilment centres and associated logistics infrastructure across India to enable its market growth,” the spokesperson said.“To achieve this goal, the company aims to provide best services to customers and is thus planning to construct regional distribution centres (RDC) across country to strengthen its network,” the official added.The company is planning to build a logistics campus in the NCR, in proximity to Gurugram. They are planning to build a campus spread over 140-acre to cater to the demand in North India.“This centre will essentially cater to parcel goods, white goods and furniture,” the spokesperson said.The land has been allotted with the condition that the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) will not provide either external or internal infrastructure for the site and creating it will be the responsibility of the allottee. “Only the infrastructure development charges will be levied,” an official said.The allotment was earlier approved by the executive empowered committee in October last year at ₹3.09 crore per acre bare shell cost.While Flipkart had deposited about ₹22 crore as earnest money, the allotment process was put on hold after the deputy CM had intervened to seek clarifications on the allotment price of ₹3.09 crore per acre.Subsequently, the HEPB had asked the HSIIDC to put a few more warehousing sites for e-auction to explore the market. In January, the HSIIDC had put up four warehousing sites of comparatively smaller sizes for auction, but there was zero response. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' French investigator shelved graft probe into Rafale jet deal: Report  The former head of the financial crimes branch of France’s public prosecution services shelved an investigation into alleged evidence of corruption in the ₹58,000-crore Rafale jet deal with India despite the objection of colleagues, according to a French media report on Tuesday.This was the second in a three-part report by Mediapart, which earlier reported Dassault Aviation, makers of the Rafale, paid a million euros to a person described as a “middleman” in connection with the deal for 36 jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF).Mediapart contended the payment was made for manufacturing 50 large models of Rafale jets, though Dassault provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA) no proof that these replicas were made.Éliane Houlette, former head of the financial crimes branch of the public prosecution services, justified her decision to shelve the investigations as preserving “the interests of France, the workings of institutions”, Mediapart reported.French President Emmanuel Macron and his predecessor, François Hollande, were cited in allegations levelled in the case, the report said.Houlette was provided a legal statement in October 2018 by a Paris-based anti-corruption NGO called Sherpa, which alerted her office to a “suspected and potentially far-reaching scam involving the French state” and Dassault, the report said.Sherpa reported, citing media revelations, about “suspected corruption, including money laundering, influence peddling and favouritism” surrounding the sale of Rafale jets to India.The statement by Sherpa – called a “signalement”, which in France is a form of official alert about suspected criminal behaviour that can be filed by entities which aren’t direct victims of the alleged crime – was “politically highly sensitive, not only because it centred on a massive arms deal agreed between governments, but also because it threatened possible ramifications” for Macron, Hollande, and Jean-Yves Le Drian, who served as Hollande’s defence minister and is currently foreign minister, the report added.Mediapart cited documents and first-hand accounts to contend that following the “potentially explosive alert” from Sherpa, Houlette made “no serious attempts to investigate the suspicions of corruption and favouritism surrounding the Rafale deal”, though she held an informal meeting with a lawyer representing Dassault.In June 2019, shortly before leaving her post, Houlette closed the preliminary investigation into Sherpa’s complaint, citing the “absence” of any offence. The move went against the advice of the deputy prosecutor in-charge of the case, who “refused to write up the official notification of it being dropped”, Mediapart reported.Houlette’s decision was validated by two magistrates of the Paris public prosecution services and enacted by her successor.

It also directed government offices to remain closed on all Saturdays for this month.Taking note of the surge in cases earlier in the day, Chief Justice Vikram Nath had said: “The issue is that things are going out of control. Now this time, Ahmedabad is in pretty bad state with 700-plus cases yesterday (Monday).”“It would be a situation where again a lockdown will have to (come)... May be three-four day of curfew or a lockdown may, you know, check the situation at the moment. Then you can open it after three-four days. But, two or three days of curfew will help I think,” he added.Advocate-General Kamal Trivedi, who was representing the state, said the government would suitably respond to the suggestions on weekend curfew but pointed that a lockdown could increase the hardships faced by the people.

              " ' Days after ambush, Maoists say missing jawan in their custody  RAIPUR The Maoists on Tuesday evening released a statement confirming that the missing CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action) commando is in their custody and sought the appointment of a mediator to whom he could be handed over.On Saturday, 22 members of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s elite CoBRA unit, District Reserve Guard (DRG), and the Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives in a five-hour long clash with Maoists, with reports suggesting that around 20 Maoists were also killed. The Maoists, however, claimed in their statement that only four of their cadres were killed.One trooper was missing and it was believed he was abducted by the Maoists, which the Tuesday release by the CPI (Maoist) confirmed. The missing CoBRA commando, Rakeshwar Singh Manhas is from Jammu.”The jawan has not been located till now . A searching drive is underway. We got information through a Maoist press release about a jawan in their custody. We are still verifying the press release and appropriate decisions will be taken accordingly,” inspector general of Bastar, P Sunderaj, said.In 2012, Hyderabad-based professor G Hargopal and former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer B D Sharma had acted as mediators when Sukma collector Alex Paul Menon was abducted by the rebels.Shubharashu Chaudhary, a peace activist working in Bastar, believes that local journalists should be roped in to hold talks as soon as possible. “Local journalists should be appointed by the government as a mediator as soon as possible “Chaudhary said.A press note issued by Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee, said: “The state government should appoint interlocutor, we will then handover the jawan to them. Until then, the jawan will be safe in the custody of Jantana Sarkar”.The statement added that four Maoist cadres were killed in Saturday’s encounter and that they seized a huge number of arms and ammunition after the attack.“Total 14 weapons and around 2,000 bullets were seized after the encounter,” the statement said. It also claimed that at least 150 villagers have been killed in operations of security forces since November 2020.In Saturday’s encounter, out of the 22 deaths, the CRPF lost eight men, including seven commandos of CoBRA and one jawan of the Bastariya battalion; eight of the other deceased were from the DRG and six from the STF.On Monday, Sunderaj said the state police were committed to bringing the commando back if reports of him being abducted were confirmed.Meanwhile, the family members of the jawan have appealed to his abductors to release him.

Some of them also demanded a hike in their honorarium.“This is our insult and humiliation,” Shabir Ahmad Lone, DDC member from Rafiabad, said then.The protest was, however, called off a day later following an assurance by Lt Governor Sinha to address the issue.The old honorarium ensured ₹35,000 per month to a DDC chairperson, ₹25,000 per month to vice chairperson and ₹15,000 per month to a DDC member.

              " ' ‘Covid infection may lead to weakening of heart muscles’  As the country battles a second wave of coronavirus, Dr Ashok Seth, chairman of Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, tells Hindustan Times what it means for people with cardiac issues, or individuals who run the risk of developing irreversible damage to their heart.How serious is the Covid-19 situation in terms of cardiac involvement?We are getting cases but fortunately, the same element of heart involvement is not there as of now as it was the last time around. It could also be because the people have largely been under home quarantine this time around, and come to hospital only when they feel sick. We will have to see in the coming weeks the exact pattern of after-effects in such patients who have recovered from Covid-19 as it takes that much of time for the effects to show.What other reason do you suspect is leading to fewer patients showing cardiac involvement?Covid-19 vaccinations have started and that, according to me, could perhaps be the reason why people may not be getting severe diseases. However, as I said, it would be too early to comment at this stage on the exact nature of involvement.What are the heart conditions that people may get due to Covid-19?Myocarditis is common, that is inflammation leading to weakening of the heart muscles, and affecting the heart’s pumping function. If the ejection fraction (the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each contraction) for anybody has dropped, it is worrying. The normal ejection fraction is about 60%. It is not that only severe cases would show cardiac involvement post Covid-19; we have seen damages even in asymptomatic patients. Blood clotting leads to heart attack and pulmonary embolism and stroke, especially in younger people. Besides this, the heart starts beating at a faster or irregular rate. However, these (effects) have not been seen at this stage.What tests can be helpful?All those who recovered from Covid-19 should get at least an Electrocardiogram or ECG and an echocardiogram (ECHO) done, especially ECHO, as some people have a weak heart. One ECHO four weeks after recovery and another three months after recovery is absolutely necessary to check on the health of the heart. There is another test for Covid-19 patients, Troponin, to detect any heart muscle damage.What is the treatment protocol for cases of heart diseases?An immediate angioplasty for patients suffering a heart attack with full PPE protection (is required) in Covid-19 cases. The treatment is to give medicines to those with weak heart muscles that will help in their function. However, these are not anti-viral medicines. We also advise against vigorous exercise and ensure sufficient rest for the heart to heal. At least 50% (of patients) could be left with residual damage, but there is an equal percentage that can potentially recover to some extent. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics coronavirus ',\n",

In fact a door-to-door vaccination programme should be chalked out,” the court added.The court also directed the state government to also examine viability of imposing night curfew to check late evening social gatherings. “The state government may also examine viability of providing masks and sanitizers to all by utilising the amount recovered on account of violation of Covid-19 protocol,” the court observed.While listing the next hearing of the case on April 8, the court said the general public should also realise its responsibility towards Covid-19 protocol. Elaborating the need for passing these directives, the court observed, “Though the state government has taken necessary steps to meet the threat of the second wave of Covid-19, but it is noticed that the directions have not been complied with by the public at large and that is an issue of concern. Having considered all the objective conditions, we deem it appropriate to direct the district magistrates of all districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh to ensure strict and definite compliance of the directions issued by the government of Uttar Pradesh from time to time to meet with the threat of Covid-19.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

As of Tuesday night, there are 843,754 active cases of Covid-19 in India. After Tuesday's tally, the seven-day average of new cases across India is 93,041 – just shy of the record high of 93,617 on September 16, 2020, considered the peak of the first wave. At the current pace, the trajectory appears set to surpass the previous peak on Wednesday. India is currently the world’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot, having surpassed the rate of daily cases in the US and Brazil last week.India’s second wave of Covid started around the third week of February, and since then, the alarming rate of new infections has forced several state government to reintroduce curbs on social movements. The rate at which cases have been rising, however, has been far more rapid than in the first wave.Maharashtra, India’s hardest-hit state, continued to dominate daily statistics with 55,469 new infections on Tuesday. With 9,921 new cases on Tuesday, Chhattisgarh had the second-highest number of daily infections in the country. Both of these states have seen their seven-day averages (48,560 and 5,949, respectively) surpass the peak of the first wave.Along with these two, three other states have so far surpassed their peaks from the first wave – Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.

              " ' Harvard study praises UP Govt for its handling of migrant crisis during pandemic  The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh (UP) handled the migrant crisis most adroitly when unforeseen challenges caused during the time of coronavirus pandemic have taken a significant toll on people globally, according to a study by Harvard University shared by the government. An official spokesman said a study conducted by Harvard University highlighted the humanitarian crisis of migrant labourers that unfolded and focused on how efficiently UP government handled the migrant crisis. Spokesman said Yogi government worked towards the multifold agenda of providing transportation facilities, delivering ration kits, and running healthcare centres for outbreak prevention. The migrant labourers mainly relied on daily wages for survival and the state government announced schemes to provide free ration to the migrants. The Harvard report dealt at length with the Yogi government ‘model’ as to how the economy of migrants was taken care of through a combined mechanism of prevention from pandemic, sustenance of their families, employment arrangements along with skill mapping and other logistics. The state government formulated a plan to ensure the safe return of migrants and create employment opportunities. UP government in consonance with the central government took a holistic approach towards addressing the crisis, the study said. Besides providing buses and train services for stranded migrants, the state government also arranged transportation facilities for within-state travel and made efforts to publicise the schemes of the government that can help migrants in the time of such crisis. The state government collaborated with Indian railways and arranged 1604 trains and brought back over 21 lakh migrants through Shramik trains i.e. 80 percent of the total migrants who returned to the state. The state government managed to bring back thousands of migrant workers from Delhi within a time span of 24 hours after the borders were sealed on March 28, 2020. Also, round-the-clock free buses were made available for migrants wanting to travel within the state. The state government followed a three-step approach for outbreak prevention – thermal screening, quarantine, and isolation. The health department formed more than 90,000 screening teams to screen the migrants and other persons, their relatives, and acquaintances if they came in contact with them. The state government also set up as many as 18140 quarantine facilities as per the guidelines issued by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and a total of 15.15 lakh migrants were quarantined at different points in time. The third step was isolation and testing of the migrants with suggestive symptoms. The state government developed two types of ration kits: 15-day ration kit and 7-day ration kit for the migrants. Over 20.67 lakh families availed of these benefits out of which 16.35 lakh were provided with the 15-day ration kit. It established community kitchens. Also, a total of ₹1,51,82,67,000 has been transferred to 15.18 lakh migrants’ account. The state government devised a three-tier system (L1, L2, and L3) to deal with suspected and positive cases of COVID-19 in the state.

              " ' ‘Outstretched’ SII chief seeks ₹3,000-crore fillip to boost supply  At a time when the demand for the Covid-19 vaccine is rising in the country amid a surge in new cases, the chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India (SII), Adar Poonawalla, on Tuesday said that the company was “very outstretched” for capacity at the moment.He added that SII needed around ₹3,000 crore to scale up production from the current capacity of 60 to 65 million per month, and that the process would take roughly three months.“We are supplying the vaccine in the Indian market at approximately ₹ 150-160. The average price of the vaccine is approximately $20 ( ₹1,500)... because of the Modi government’s request, we are providing vaccines at subsidised rates... It is not that we are not making profits... but we are not making a super profit, which is key to re-investing,” Poonawalla told NDTV.“This (the amount needed) would be roughly ₹3,000 crores. The process takes 85 days, so it would be just under three months before we scale up operations,” he added. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is manufactured by SII and sold in India under the brand name Covishield.“We are supplying two million doses per day. It varies... but we are making between 60 and 65 million per month. We have given, so far, over 100 million doses to India, and exported over 60 million,” Poonawalla said in the interview, adding that supply constraints will only ease once other manufacturers also scale up capacity.“We hope that, with them, even Covishield will increase capacity to 100 to 110 million doses a month (but) that’s only going to happen from June. That’s where we are at the moment,” he said.Covishield is one of the two Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in India. The other Covid-19 vaccine is Covaxin that is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and India Council of Medical Research.“Very stressed to put it quite frankly. The globe needs this vaccine... we are prioritising the needs of India (but) we are still short of being able to supply to every Indian,” Poonawalla told NDTV.Last month, COVAX facility, a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, said that it was looking at supply delays to the tune of at least 60-70 million doses produced by SII to lower-income countries because India was slowing down its Covid-19 vaccine exports.“We provided Serum Institute of India 150 million in pre finance to ramp up production. Our agreement stipulates 50% of production to be given to COVAX. Through Serum Institute of India, COVAX provides Covid-19 vaccines to more than 60 low income countries, primarily in Asia and Africa. If Government of India bans export of doses, all those countries would suffer,” Anuradha Gupta, deputy, chief executive officer, Gavi- the vaccine alliance that is co-leading COVAX facility, told HT on March 26..

              " ' Night curfew in Delhi: DM offices prepare as scramble for e-passes begin  District magistrates across Delhi received at least 30,000 applications seeking exemptions from the city’s night curfew restrictions announced on Tuesday, said officials with knowledge of developments.Having received the night curfew order just nine hours prior to its implementation, city authorities also started preparations to issue the necessary passes and coordinate efforts to enforce the curbs.The city government on Tuesday clamped a curfew on movement and assembly of people between 10pm and 5am until April 30. Government officials, essential workers, those travelling to and from airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres or hospitals will be exempt from the seven-hour night curfew, according to the order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The district magistrate of south zone called an emergency meeting of the district disaster management authority to fix responsibility for each stakeholder. “We have asked the South Delhi Municipal Corporation to ensure that restaurants and other non-essential shops are shut by 10pm. The deputy commissioner of police (DCP) will ensure there is no movement or assembly of people during the curfew hours, except for those exempted,” said a senior district official, who did not wish to be named.Also Read| Traders say Delhi govt should have consulted before announcing night curfewThe south district received around 2,500 applications for e-passes, the official added.Ramchandra Shingare, additional district magistrate (east) said police was asked to barricade roads to ensure restricted movement of traffic.“We have asked Delhi Police for enhanced deployment of staff in the night to implement the curfew. The police will barricade the roads and ensure no movement of people, except the exempted categories, without e-pass,” Shingare said.Sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) in all districts have been directed to be on the field from 9pm to midnight to monitor the situation, said officials with knowledge of developments. District magistrates have also ordered deployment of administration teams to assist the police. Also, the district control room will work round-the-clock at the DM’s office to monitor the curfew and issue e-passes, said officials in several districts.The east district received around 1,500 applications for e-passes, of which 250 were rejected and around 180 were approved.The New Delhi and the Southwest districts received at least 4,000 applications each.A senior official in the New Delhi district said they cleared about 1,000 applications. “It is likely that the police will also soon start issuing these passes, then the pendency will reduce. It will also help to enforce the curfew better as verifying the applications individually takes time. A number of people have been assigned to handle e-pass applications,,” said the official. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the government was alert and keeping a “close watch” on the situation.“The positivity rate yesterday was 5.54%, and around 65,000 tests were conducted. Orders were issued to escalate the number of beds in both private and Delhi government hospitals. Almost 5,000 beds are being added for Covid positive cases,” he told reporters.Police said that it will strictly enforce the night curfew order and soon issue movement passes on demand to those eligible.“Delhi Police will strictly enforce it except for the exempted categories mentioned in the order,” said Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.Police had earlier issued movement passes to facilitate the movement of persons engaged in essential services and commodities, Biswal said.“Fresh movement passes will be issued on demand. Those eligible can also visit Delhi Police website to apply for it. All field functionaries will be available to enforce the DDMA order and facilitate the exempted people,” he added.

              " ' One arrested over demolition of Sai Baba statue  New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they arrested a 50-year-old man in connection with the demolition of a statue of Shirdi Sai Baba in a temple in South Delhi’s Shahpur Jat last week. Police said the arrested man, identified as Padam Panwar, was purportedly seen in a video clip, which was widely circulated on social media, proclaiming that Sai Baba is a Muslim and not a God.Panwar, a resident of Shahpur Jat, was arrested on Monday, a day after police registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli\\xadgious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli\\xadgious beliefs), said a senior police officer who did not want to be named.The officer said that police began enquiring into the demolition after receiving a complaint from local devotees on April 3. The first information report was registered on April 4. “Panwar was arrested after his role was confirmed. He has been sent to jail,” the officer added.Police said that during questioning, some people claimed that they intended to replace the statue as it was found to be cracked. However, when HT contacted Panwar, he had said that he decided to get it removed as Sai Baba was a Muslim. “I personally got the statue installed in 2009. But now that I got to know that Sai Baba was a Muslim, I got the statue removed. Sai Baba was no God, he was a common man,” Panwar, who is in the real estate business, had said.In the video doing the rounds of social media, a man is purportedly seen using tools to demolish the statue after which Panwar comes to the fore, and says, “This temple was constructed by my ancestors even before Shirdi Baba was born. But I have got to know he is Muslim. He cannot share the same space that is occupied by Hindu gods.”A video also emerged in which Panwar is purportedly seen in the company of Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati -- a priest of Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad -- who was booked by the Delhi Police on Saturday for allegedly making inflammatory comments against the Prophet at a press conference in the national capital.

              " ' Traders say Delhi govt should have consulted before announcing night curfew  As the clock struck eight, Amrit Kishore quickly packed the last set of cotton t-shirts that were put on display outside his 30-square-feet shop in Sarojini Nagar before he could pull down the shutter and travel nearly 35 kms on his scooter to reach his residence at Jharoda in the southwest Delhi.“It would be better if the government had given us some more time. Traders would be more prepared,” said Kishore, referring to the government announcing a night curfew in the city on Tuesday in the light of a severe spike in the Covid-19 cases in the Capital. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 5,100 new cases and 17 more deaths.Market associations, traders and business owners across the city said they were not prepared for a curfew with some of them saying that to ensure that they reach home by 10pm, they will have to shut their shops early. Several of them also criticised the government’s move questioning the efficacy of night curfews in arresting the rapid spread of Covid-19.During the seven-hour curfew period, from 10 pm to 5 am, movement of only government officials, healthcare workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed“We hardly got time to initiate an awareness drive. People learnt about the night curfew after they arrived in the market today. We still managed to ensure that all shops are closed by 8.30pm. On usual days, they wrap up by 10 pm. Several traders come from faraway places such as Ghaziabad and Gurugram. The night curfew will pose additional challenges for them,,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar mini market welfare association.Devraj Baweja, general secretary of confederation of Sadar Bazar traders’ association, said it was a difficult task today to ensure that the market closed exceptionally early on Tuesday. “Also, the news of the night curfew spread panic among traders and workers. The government should have done this in a more systematic manner and given more time to the traders,” Baweja said.The night curfew meant restaurants, bars and pubs in the city had to wrap up quickly for Tuesday and make plans for the days ahead.Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said the government should have held discussions with hotels and restaurant groups before taking the decision. “I personally do not see a solution in night curfews, especially when the central government has also said that such a curb is not much efficient. It will adversely affect hotels and restaurants which are already in poor shape because of the pandemic and lockdown.”The night curfew also means several hotels now have to make special arrangements for clients who had already booked halls for weddings and private functions this month.Rohit Arora, area general manager of The Park hotel in Connaught Place said, “We adopted flexible timings for weddings and other events. We have rescheduled the events to a couple of hours earlier, which allows both the guests to enjoy their event and us to be a law-abiding entity. We are sensitive about guest security and place utmost importance on safety and hygiene, hence in case of weddings, we are requesting guests to stay back in our hotel rooms for the night. As far as dining is concerned, our in-house guests are welcome to eat till midnight. We stand both by the law and order and our patrons to operate smoothly.”Several banquet hall and hotel owners in the city said that they started calling up their clients after the news of the night curfew broke out on Tuesday, telling them that they will have to wrap up the celebrations by 10 pm now.“Several clients were already agitated after the government limited the number of guests in marriage functions. Now the night curfew order means they will have to wrap up their limited celebrations too by 10 pm. It is getting difficult for us to convince them. But it is a government order and has to be followed,” said Purushottam Kalra, president of Shamiyana Dealer Vyapar Sudhar Samiti – an association of banquet halls in the city.Last month, the government imposed a cap of maximum 200 guests for marriage functions hosted outdoors, 100 for indoors and 50 for funerals.Sandeep Khandelwal of Delhi hotels and restaurants owners’ association said: “The government should have talked to hotel, restaurant and banquet hall owners before taking this call. Compliance was difficult on Tuesday because the order was issued on such short notice. But the coming days will pose financial challenges. The hospitality industry is already in poor shape.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics new delhi coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' CM orders speeding up redesigning of major arterial roads  New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday directed public works department (PWD) officials to expedite work on redesigning major arterial roads measuring 540 kilometres and also asked them to complete the project within its 2023 deadline. Kejriwal also visited a redesigned road stretch, which is being redeveloped on a pilot basis, near Sriniwaspuri in south Delhi to review the project.The instructions were issued by the CM on Tuesday, during a meeting to review the status of the ongoing road redesigning and streetscaping project.“The process of designing the roads should be done in a swift manner and the project should be completed within the stipulated deadline, i.e., by 2023. The PWD should ensure the removal of all obstacles, the project needs to be completed in two years. The tender process and other formalities should be completed as soon as possible for rapid completion of the project,” Kejriwal said in a statement issued by the government. PWD officials assured the chief minister that the tender process would be completed in the one to two months and work would begin by the middle of this year, a statement issued by the government said. The government further said that considerable progress has been made on a 35km stretch under the pilot project. The deadline to complete the pilot projects is October 2021. “Redevelopment of about 5.5 km-long road from Ring Road (AIIMS) to Ashram has been completed. Redevelopment of about 6 km of road from Wazirpur Depot Crossing to Rithala Metro Station is ongoing. Work is also underway on a road of about 5.2 km from Britannia Chowk to Outer Ring Road in Pitampura’s West Enclave area. Similarly, the work of beautification of a 3.1-km-long road from Shivdaspuri Marg to Patel Road, Moti Nagar T-Point to Pusa Road and Laxmi Nagar to Karkari Mor on Vikas Marg is underway,” the statement said. It added that the work will be completed by the end of this year. The government further said that redesigning of roads will eliminate bottlenecks and improve aesthetics of the road stretch. “Currently, a road turns from four lanes to three lanes or from six lanes to four lanes. This suddenly increases the pressure of vehicles at a place on the road and creates a bottleneck. After redesigning of roads, this problem will be eradicated by improving the geometry of roads. The space alongside the roads will be optimised. Sidewalks will be created and a separate segment for non-motorised vehicles will also be made,” the statement said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Early lung infections new Covid concern  A couple from south Mumbai in their 60s consulted a doctor last week after having a fever for two days. When the doctor examined them with the help of a stethoscope, he heard what are known as bilateral crackles, sounds from the lungs that suggest pneumonia. Sure enough, in both their cases, a Covid-19 test returned positive and a CT scan of the lung confirmed pneumonia. But what surprised the doctor, a consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, was the progression of the lung infection. In the past, Covid-19 linked pneumonia was seen after at least 10 days of symptoms, but in this senior couple, pneumonia set in on the third day. And that, experts say, may well be the story of Mumbai’s second wave. “Involvement of the lung within the second or third day of the onset of symptoms is concerning,” said Dr Samrat Shah, who treated the senior couple. Shah said their lungs were considerably diseased, and the CT scan severity score was above 7, which meant that they had already crossed the mild stage of the infection. CT scans of many positive patients are revealing faster pulmonary changes even as severity scores are rapidly rising, doctors said. The result: more patients require intensive treatment and hospitalisation, although, on the positive side, most recover. Given their age, the couple were put on intravenous steroids and antiviral medication and are now on the road to recovery. According to Dr. Shah, almost 30% of his patients are showing signs of early lung infections. During the last wave, only very few patients would show up with such early infections, he said. Dr Khusrav Bajan, a physician, and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said almost 15% of his Covid-19 patients are suffering from an early lung infection. “Last year, such cases were about 5% to 10%,” he added. A CT-scan severity score ranges from 0 to 25; 7 to 12 indicates moderate infection; above 12 indicates a severe infection; below 7 indicates mild infection. “I have so many patients who are slipping from a score of 5 to 20 within a day. They typically have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Also, a peculiar trend is that young people, under 45 years of age, are coming with such early infections,” said Dr Bajan. From reporting an average of 526 cases per day in January, Mumbai’s daily average rose to 655 cases per day in February and jumped sharply to 2866 cases per day in March. The city reported an average of 9500 per day in the first five days of April. The number of active cases in the city has jumped by at least 700% within a month’s time: from 9055 on March 5 to 73,281 on April 5. According to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard, 12707 patients are currently hospitalised. Of these, 1776 are admitted to intensive care units. Another 1937 patients are admitted in Covid Care Centre (CCC2) that are meant for positive, asymptomatic patients. Around 2% of the total active cases are critical. “Even as the numbers have risen, and more patients are symptomatic, the response rate to therapy is much better. This helps as patients don’t get to the critical state,” said Dr. Pratit Samdani who is currently treating one unusual case of a 65-year-old jeweller who developed lung fibrosis on the seventh day of hospitalisation. Lung fibrosis is a severe condition wherein the lung tissues are severely scarred and the damage is irreversible. “We generally see fibrosis after three to four weeks. It is unusual to develop fibrosis so soon,” he said. Some experts say it is possible that the sheer volume of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave has resulted in doctors observing such trends more clearly. “Some patients definitely deteriorate faster. We are also seeing significantly affected lungs in patients but we did see a similar trend last year too,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care physician at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “I think what is concerning right now is the overwhelming number of cases.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Only those involved in essential services to be allowed on Metro, DTC buses  New Delhi: Only those identified as essential service providers will be allowed to take public transport such as the Metro and DTC buses between 10pm and 5am during which a curfew will remain in effect to curb the rising Covid-19 cases in the city, an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) says.Officials of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Limited that run the 6,600-odd state-run buses in the city, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said their operations will continue as usual, but entry of passengers will be strictly regulated on the basis of ID cards and e-passes after 10pm.The DMRC advised commuters to plan their travel according to the restrictions and reach their destinations by 10pm.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “In view of the imposition of night curfew in Delhi starting tonight, entry in Metro from 10pm to 5am will be allowed only to those passengers who fall in essential category as per govt order, after verification of their valid IDs by DMRC or CISF personnel.”Metro users commuting between Delhi and NCR will have to plan travel as it takes over an hour to complete end-to-end journey on Yellow line (Samaypur Badli to HUDA city centre) and Blue line (Noida City centre to Dwarka sector 21). There are no restrictions on public movement in Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram.After the DMRC tweeted a travel advisory after the DDMA order, commuters posted several queries regarding the restrictions. “What if someone boards a train at 9:30 and has an hour long journey, Would you throw him out at 10PM?” tweeted KD Singh in response to DMRC’s travel advisory.In DTC buses, officials said, marshals and conductors will enforce the night curfew. A DTC spokesperson said, “The corporation will follow the DDMA order in letter and spirit. Our major bus operations happen during the morning hours, while during the night, the frequency and the number of buses on the road is comparatively less. Bus marshals and conductors will be responsible for checking the IDs and e-passes of passengers,” said the spokesperson.A senior transport department official said cluster buses will be available only for passengers involved in essential services and those falling in the exempted category carrying valid ID cards or e-passes. Delhi has around 2,900 cluster buses which operate between 4.30am and 11.30pm. “This timings will remain the same,” the official said.The official said the same rule will apply to cabs and auto-rickshaws. “In general, there will be fewer cabs and autos available because demand will reduce as most people will stay indoors post 10 pm. The Delhi police and enforcement officers from the district magistrate’s offices will do random checks on the roads. So, it is better to avoid venturing out during the night, unless it’s a health emergency,” the official said.Uber and Ola did not comment on the matter.

              " ' Emergency vehicles to be allowed in revamped Chandni Chowk stretch: Jain  New DelhiVehicles pressed into emergency and those under essential services will be allowed into the revamped areas of Chandni Chowk where entry of motorised vehicles is to be barred from 9am to 9pm on April 17, public works department (PWD) minister Satyendar Jain said on Tuesday. As part of the much-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, a 1.3km stretch of the main road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri mosque has been completely pedestrianised. The stretch is likely to be inaugurated on slated for inauguration on April 17, after which entry of all motorised vehicles will be banned on it between 9am and 9pm. While reviewing the ongoing work on Tuesday, Jain said that vehicles such as ambulances, fogging vehicles, police vans, bank cash and security vans, and those providing essential services will be allowed on to the revamped area. He also directed officials to create standard operating procedures (SOPs) for essential and emergency services in the area. “Chandni Chowk is a historical site. It has been made beautiful to promote tourism and it is the responsibility of all of us to maintain its beauty. It is the responsibility of Delhi Police to ensure that rules are followed. It will be the responsibility of the local police to ban the entry of motor vehicles in the restricted area,” said Jain in a statement, shared by the government on Tuesday. He added that only authorised manual rickshaws, color-coded in a particular style, will be allowed to enter the revamped stretch. Shopkeepers in the area too will be allowed to move their wares only on these rickshaws. While the redevelopment project was proposed in 2006, work on the project finally started in December 2018 following the directions and under monitoring of the Delhi high court. In December 2018, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia laid the foundation stone for the project. During the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric cables have been shifted underground, with facilities such as toilets and benches for sitting being provided. CCTV and streetlights in the area are yet to be completely installed. On Tuesday, Jain also instructed officials to install powerful LEDs in the area since the current lights on the stretch were feeble in terms of security considerations. Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), which is the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, said that finishing touches were being given ahead of the inauguration of the 1.3-km stretch on April 17. “The inauguration is scheduled for April 17 and whatever work remains will be completed by then,” said Panigrahi.

              " ' Admission process for EWS, disabled students in entry-level classes begins today  The online registration process for admission to entry-level classes for seats reserved under the reserved economically weaker section (EWS), disadvantaged groups (DG), and children with disabilities categories for the academic session 2021-22 in the city’s private schools will begin from Wednesday, the Delhi government said.Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act of 2009, at least 25% of seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten, and Class 1— have to be reserved for EWS/DG (22%) and children with disabilities (3%). HT had on Sunday reported that while the new academic session had started in schools across the national capital last week, the admission process for these 25% reserved seats was delayed, causing anxiety among parents seeking to enrol their children in private schools.Officials at the DoE had cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason behind the delay in starting admissions for the reserved seats. This year, the application process for 75% general category seats too had been delayed by over two months due to the pandemic.According to a notification released by the Directorate of Education (DoE) on Tuesday, the forms for reserved categories will be available on the official website (edudel.nic.in) from Wednesday, and the last date of submission of the same will be April 26. The first list of selected candidates will be released on April 30. Applicants have been asked to file only one application. “Multiple applications filed by any individual applicant shall lead to cancellation of candidature of the applicant, even after succeeding in the draw of lots,” the notification said.All private schools affiliated by the three municipal corporations — north, south, and east — as well as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) will also be in the computerised admission system.The DoE has fixed an upper age limit of 5, 6, and 7 years as of March 31, 2021, for admission in nursery, kindergarten, and Class 1, respectively. The minimum age for admission in these classes is 3, 4, and 5 years as of March 31, 2021, respectively. However, the upper age limit for children with disabilities is 9 years for admission to these classes.Families having less than an annual income of ₹1 lakh can apply for admission under the EWS category. “Any person residing in Delhi, having the residence proof of Delhi and requisite Income Certificate (less than one lakh rupees annually) issued by the Revenue Department of GNCT of Delhi, BPL/AAY( ration card/ food security cardholder) are eligible for applying in these private unaided recognized schools for admission of their ward under EWS category,” the notification read.Under the disadvantaged groups category, Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe, Other Backward Class (non-creamy layer), orphans, transgender, and all children living with or affected by HIV, can apply, according to the DoE notification. Applicants under the children with disabilities category must have to submit a disability certificate issued from a government hospital as per the guidelines issued under the Right of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016.“Income certificate is also not required for applicant sunder Children with Disabilities Category,” the notification added.Meanwhile, some experts raised concerns over the short period for the application process this year. Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organization working with EWS children in Delhi, said, “It will be very difficult for poor children to fill forms at such short notice. It has to be opened for at least a month. Poor children should not be made to pay for the lack of planning and foresight of the education department.”Anil Kumar, a labourer at Molarband extension in Badarpur who is seeking admission for his sons, aged 5 and 6, said he was relieved that the government initiated the admission process for reserved category.“I was really worried due to the delay in the commencement of admission process. I just hope that my sons get seats in a good private school under the EWS category,” he said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi government ',\n",
              " ' Jab for those who ‘need’ it, not those who ‘want’ it: Centre  As India faces the worst wave of the Covid-19 pandemic yet, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and chief ministers of several states have appealed to the central government to open vaccination for all people above 18, even as Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan resorted to semantics in the health ministry’s briefing on Tuesday, saying “the aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it, but to those who need it”.Experts pointed out that in the case of the coronavirus disease, no one is safe till everyone is safe – and in this case this means everyone over the age of 18 (neither of the vaccines in use in India has yet been approved for those below the age of 18). Other experts pointed that even if vaccines must be administered in a prioritised manner, it would make sense to prioritise urban centres, especially those that are seeing a huge surge in infections.“In cities, if we immunise about 30-40% (given that 45-55% have been infected), we should be in reasonable shape and begin to see slowing. However, there are lots of caveats such as duration of protection, variant escape, etc. In rural areas, we will need greater coverage to see a difference. But ultimately we will need to get everyone immunised including children,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologist.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, IMA said: “At present, we are vaccinating the population above 45 years. In view of the rapid spread of the second wave of the disease, we suggest that our vaccination strategy needs to be geared up with immediate effect. All citizens above 18 years of age shall be permitted to receive Covid vaccination.”Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote a similar letter to the PM, seeking removal of the age bar on vaccination. “I appeal to the Prime Minister and the Central government to allow the vaccination for all by removing the age bar,” the letter read. “Also, in addition to the two vaccines currently being used in India, other vaccines should be allowed, so that more and more people can be vaccinated in the earliest possible manner,” it added.India is expected to approve the Sputnik V vaccine shortly.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, and his Maharashtra and Delhi counterparts, Uddhav Thackeray and Arvind Kejirwal, have made similar appeals to the Centre. On Monday, Kejriwal wrote to the Prime Minister, saying “if rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months.”India has so far administered 84 million vaccine doses till Tuesday night, according to HT’s vaccine tracker. Of this, 10,904,088 people have received both doses and 62,257,181 have received one dose. On Monday, the country vaccinated 4,300,966 people, a new high. According to an HT analysis last week, if India vaccinates 4 million people a day, it would have completely vaccinated 50 million people (both doses) by May 15 and 100 million people by June 16. It takes two weeks after the second dose for the vaccine to be completely effective.On Tuesday, India added a record 115,320 new cases in a single day, taking its overall tally of cases to 11,789,781; 630 people died from Covid-10 on Tuesday. The current seven-day average of cases is 93,041.IMA has also suggested that private sector family clinics should be included actively in the vaccination drive along with private hospitals. Making vaccination certificate mandatory for entering public places and to receive products under the public distribution system were among the several suggestions made by the doctors’ body as ways to dispel vaccine hesitancy.In the health ministry briefing, Bhushan sought to explain the rationale for the government’s phased approach to vaccination.“It is a common question that is being asked these days that why are not Covid-19 vaccinations being opened for all; why can’t all adults be given it. To those, I want to say that Covid-19 vaccination drive is essentially meant to serve two purposes: to prevent deaths and the other purpose is to protect your health care system. In the middle of a pandemic, the main aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. The most vulnerable in the country have to be protected, and that is what is being done globally also,” said Bhushan.“The basic aim is to reduce death through vaccination. The other aim is to protect your healthcare system. If healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics and others fall sick, who will work in hospitals? So the aim, for any country, is to protect those who are the most vulnerable,” he said.Bhushan later told ANI it was “a fallacy that our vaccination process is heavily regulated and controlled by the state”.Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said: “What we know so far is that all vaccines that are being used, including the two being used in ,India reduce mortality, severity of the disease, protect lives and keeping that in mind priority groups have been decided. We have to protect our most vulnerable.” He said the priority groups have been decided based on people vulnerable to mortality.“Pandemic situation no doubt has deteriorated in the country, as there has been a serious rise in Covid-19 cases. It has risen like a wave, and this time the speed of rise is greater than the previous time,” said Paul.India’s vaccine drive began on January 16 with health care workers, and on February 2 with frontline workers, and then moved, on March 1, to people over the age of 60 and those over the age of 45 but with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19.On April 1, the country started vaccinating everyone over the age of 45.

              " ' Andhra HC suspends elections to block, zilla parishads scheduled for Thursday  The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday issued interim orders suspending the elections to the mandal (block) parishads and zilla parishads in the state, which are scheduled to be held on Thursday (April 8). The High Court cited insufficient time for the enforcement of the model code of conduct for its decision.A single-judge bench of the High Court, comprising Justice U Durga Prasada Rao, gave the orders after hearing a batch of petitions filed by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jana Sena Party.Justice Rao agreed with the contention of the petitioners that the state election commission (SEC) had not followed the Supreme Court orders directing that the model code of conduct should be brought into force at least four weeks before the polling date.The HC ordered that the notification issued by newly-appointed SEC Neelam Sawhney on April 1, and all the actions taken thereafter, be withheld. The court did not accept the SEC’s argument that the four-week gap between the notification and polling date for enforcement of the model code of conduct was only a suggestion and not a compulsion.Justice Rao posted the case to April 15 for further hearing and directed the SEC to file a counter by then. It also asked the SEC to follow the Supreme Court guidelines on the enforcement of the model code of conduct for four weeks before the polling date.An official in the state government said the SEC was contemplating challenging Justice Rao’s interim order by filing an emergency petition before a division bench late in the evening or Wednesday morning.Sawhney, who replaced Nimmgadda Ramesh Kumar as the SEC on April 1, announced the schedule for the conduct of mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) within hours of taking charge.As per the schedule, the polling will be held on April 8 and the results will be declared on April 10. Since the polling process commenced in March 2020, before it was postponed due to the outbreak of Covid-19, there was no need for the issuance of fresh notification, Sawhney said.In all, there are 660 ZPTCs and 9,984 MPTCs in Andhra Pradesh, of which as many as 126 ZPTCs and 2,363 MPTCs were elected unanimously during the beginning of the election process in March 2020. As per the schedule announced on April 1, the campaigning came to an end by 4 pm on Tuesday.The opposition parties found fault with the SEC for hurriedly announcing the schedule without following the SC guidelines on the model code of conduct. The TDP said it would boycott the elections, alleging the ruling YSR Congress party of trying to bulldoze the election process with the help of the SEC and the police machinery.

              " ' ‘Distracted’ while driving, woman runs over elderly couple in Dwarka  A 79-year-old doctor and his 62-year-old wife died after they were hit and run over by a car being driven by a 28-year-old woman at Sector-11, Dwarka in southwest Delhi on Sunday evening, the police said. The couple was out for an evening stroll when the accident took place at around 6.30 pm. The accident was captured in a CCTV camera installed at a mosque across the road.The driver, identified as Deepakshi Choudhary, was arrested and booked for rash driving or riding in a public way and causing death by negligence, a case regarding which was registered under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 304A and 279 at Dwarka South police station. Choudhary, who works in a multinational company, was later released on bail from the police station itself. Her grey Baleno car involved in the accident was impounded by the police.The dead couple was identified as Shanti Swaroop Arora and his wife Anjana Arora. They lived in Appu Enclave in Sector-11, Dwarka and their children are settled in the US. Choudhary lives in the same society, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.There were claims that Chaudhary was learning how to drive when the accident took place. However, the information could not be verified independently. Quoting Chaudhary’s statement on how the accident took place, DCP Meena said she told the police that she was thinking about something and lost focus because of which she lost control over the vehicle.Police said Chaudhary did not flee the mishap spot and accompanied the injured couple to the hospital. She was at the hospital when the police team reached there after receiving a call about the accident.In the 6.09 minutes video footage, the couple is seen walking on Masjid Wali Road and two more men are seen there. After crossing the building on which the CCTV is installed, the couple takes a U-turn and go to the left side of the road when suddenly, a grey car moving at a slow speed in the middle of the road starts moving towards them and hit them. The couple falls on the road and the car runs over them. While the elderly man is trapped under the car, his wife is struck under in the back portion of the vehicle, the video shows.The footage shows two people rushing towards the car as the driver comes out and go where the woman’s body is seen trapped under the vehicle. Chaudhary can then be seen taking out her cellphone from the car and calling someone frantically.More people rushed to the accident site and pushed the car to rescue the woman trapped underneath. After she was taken aside, some people tried to lift the front portion of the car to take out the injured man. However, when they failed, the went towards the driver side and again tried to lift the vehicle a bit to pull the man from under the vehicle.Sheikh Abdullah, who was involved in the rescue operation, said he had come to the mosque to perform evening prayers when he heard a commotion outside and rushed to see what happened.“It was horrible. The elderly man was injured but conscious while I rushed him to a nearby hospital in my car. On the way, he was talking to me and saying he had suffered fractures in his left hand. He also enquired about his wife and asked me to stop my car so that he could see if his wife was also being taken to the hospital. She was unconscious and taken to the hospital in the same car that ran over her,” said Abdullah, who runs a diagnostic centre in Palam. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi news ',\n",
              " ' Justice NV Ramana appointed as CJI  President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday appointed justice NV Ramana as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) with effect from April 24. Justice Ramana, 63, will serve till August 26, 2022.The presidential notification followed the recommendation made by incumbent CJI SA Bobde to the union law ministry on March 24 regarding appointment of justice Ramana as his successor.“In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution. The President is pleased to appoint Sri Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana, judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Chief Justice of India with effect from April 24, 2021,” the notification issued by the law ministry stated.Justice Ramana was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judgeWith this, both the CJI and the central government have followed the seniority norm, as laid down under the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for judicial appointments. As per the MoP, appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, considered fit to hold the office.The speculations around appointment of justice Ramana as the next CJI had ensued in the wake of a formal complaint against him by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who accused the senior judge of influencing the state high court and stalling investigations into the Amaravati land scam case in which the judge’s daughters were also being probed. Jagan contended in a letter to the CJI that the Andhra Pradesh high court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.On the day justice Bobde recommended justice Ramana as the top judge, the Supreme Court also issued a short statement about the dismissal of Reddy’s complaint.Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held.In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.

              " ' One killed as girder falls on parked trucks  A 50-year-old watchman was killed after a concrete and iron girder of an under-construction railway bridge fell on four trucks in west Delhi’s Dayabasti near Punjabi Bagh on Tuesday morning, police said.Police identified the victim as Ram Bahadur, who worked as a watchman for trucks parked underneath the bridge. “He was sleeping in one of the trucks on which the beam fell. He was crushed to death,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam.While a statement issued by the northern railway claimed the girder fell “during construction of a grade separator at Dayabasti”, police said that no construction work was going on at the site for the past one and a half years or so.Police said Bahadur, who hailed from Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh, was living in Ashoka Park near Mata Mandir in Punjabi Bagh. While a few locals reached the spot after the collapse “around 10 pm”, a police officer, who did not want to be named, said that the locals didn’t reach out to them as it was dark and they did not notice anyone trapped under the girder.In the morning, when Bahadur did not return home, his family members went to the spot along with some locals and found him trapped in one of the damaged trucks. His nephew called the police and informed about the incident, the officer said.In the statement, the railways said that the grade separator at Dayabasti is being constructed by one of the agencies of northern railway and the work is in progress. Around 10 pm on Monday, one of the girders launched for the viaduct of the grade separator fell down, damaging some of the unauthorised vehicles parked below it, the statement said.“Further investigation by the police is going on to find out any casualty/trapped person below the fallen girder. Reasons for the incidence is being examined,” the statement read.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that two fire tenders along with the rescue teams were also sent to the spot. Apart from the local Punjabi Bagh police, teams of disaster management and CATS ambulance also reached the mishap spot. The girder was removed using a hydraulic crane, following which Bahadur’s body was taken out and shifted to a government hospital mortuary. Police said a case was registered.

              " ' RWAs promise all help to authorities as Covid night curfew begins  Resident Welfare Associations of the city said they will ensure that all colony gates are closed early, as well as extend all possible cooperation to the police and district administration officials to ensure that no Covid-19 protocols are violated during the night curfew, which comes into effect from Tuesday.Several RWAs, on Tuesday, started sharing messages about the night curfew on their WhatsApp groups, along with copies of the government order, while appealing to the residents to adhere to rules, they said.The Delhi government on Tuesday imposed a night curfew — that will be in place every day from 10pm to 5am — in order to arrest the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the city. Delhi on Tuesday added 5,100 fresh cases, at the back of 103,453 tests, returning a positivity rate of 4.93%The night curfew will be in place at least till April 30. During the seven-hour curfew period, movement of only government officials, health care workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed, said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its order.“We will ensure that the colony and park gates are closed early and limit entry-exit points after 10pm. Food delivery service providers will be asked to call clients on reaching the colony gates so that even if they get access, they do not have to walk into buildings looking out for addresses floor by floor. Residents can step out and pick up their food orders if needed,” said Rajiv Kakria, member of the residents’ welfare group in Greater Kailash-1.Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, which is a collective of around 1,800 RWAs in the city, said: “For residential areas which have proper gates, adhering to a night curfew is not that difficult. The problem is with those which do not have gates and those close to market areas. In these areas, the RWAs have to invest a lot of effort to ensure compliance.”“In such areas, the RWAs have to work closely with the police and district administration. They help decide where temporary barricades are to be installed, which access routes should be kept open and what mechanisms should be in place for emergencies. The WhatsApp groups play an important role. In these groups, the RWAs also share with their residents, updates on Covid-19 in their area, which gives them a fair idea of the situation and helps in ensuring adherence to regulations,” said BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA front – another collective of resident groups.Amit Agarwal of United Residents Joint Action, a collective of around 2,700 RWAs in the city, said: “RWAs in the city are always there to help the government implement regulations that are aimed at controlling Covid-19. But the government should consider consulting them before regulations, such as the night curfew, are drafted.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics new delhi coronavirus ',\n",
              " ' As new cases rise, police step up watch on Covid violators  New Delhi:As Covid-19 cases are steadily increasing across the city, prompting the state government to impose night curfew starting Tuesday, prosecution data related to violation of Covid-19 guidelines shows police have caught at least 1,800-2,000 persons every day over the past few days.Until last month, police were issuing fines to only around 130-160 persons every day for violating Covid measures, such as the use of mask and social distancing, which have been set in place to reduce the spread of the infection. With night curfew already in place to tackle the fourth wave, Delhi police officers said that they have increased enforcement across the city.Data on police prosecution, seen by HT, shows that in February, when the positivity rate had reached a low of 0.17% (February 16) and cases had declined, only 40 persons were fined on an average each day for not wearing masks. The Covid-19 cases started increasing since mid-February and in March, at least 501 persons were fined every day. The average figure has now increased to at least 1,718 every day ( between April 1 and 6).To be clear, the daily prosecution number is close to what it was during the third wave of the infection in October-November. Delhi was recording a daily average of 3,451 new cases in October and 6,122 in November.Police data shows that in the past five days, cases have been registered against a wide spectrum of people, ranging from the owner of a small eatery in Gole Market to the management of a posh resto bar in Connaught Place. Apart from this, at least three persons were fined inside a city five-star hotel for not wearing masks and a night club owner in west Delhi was also fined for not adhering to the guidelines.While the first offence only attracts a fine, police said they would register an FIR if the person continues to violate the guidelines.“For those not following Covid-appropriate behaviour, we are registering cases under the Indian Penal Code and the Epidemic Disease Act. This includes owners of shops, restaurants and the places where they were not adhering to social distancing norms. Separately, we are issuing fines of ₹2,000 to those who are not wearing masks,” said deputy commissioner of police and Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.The DCP said that separate teams have been formed in every police station to ensure that residents are following social distancing norms, especially in the evening when restaurants and markets see a high footfall. “The number of teams to check on Covid enforcement at each police station has also increased. Our aim is not to fine citizens but to ensure that they follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, so that the infection is under control,” he said.During the weekend, police had registered at least 17 FIRs during a special drive on checking for violations. In west Delhi alone, especially in restaurants at Rajouri Garden, Raja Garden and Tilak Nagar, police conducted inspections and fined owners/management of 14 establishments for violating the guidelines. The enforcement, police said, would be inside the establishments as well as on the road.With people arguing and refusing to pay ₹2,000 fines, police have also started taking videos of violators. “We are recording the videos as evidence in cases, where people contest and refuse to accept that they were not wearing masks or violating social distancing. We are inspecting banquet halls, restaurant, and night clubs where the footfall is very high in the evening hours,” a police officer, who did not wish to be named said.During the first three waves of the infection, the fine was only ₹500. The fine was increased to ₹2,000 on November 19, last year, when government and police agencies realised that citizens were not willing to follow the mask rule during the third wave.The Delhi government had on Friday said that the city was witnessing the fourth wave of the infection. For the last 10 days, the city has recorded 2,923 cases on an average each day. Police said the enforcement on roads will increase until the fourth wave of the infection recedes.

              " ' HC seeks clarity on plan to demolish Lal Masjid  New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought to know from the Centre and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) by Wednesday if they had plans to demolish the Lal Masjid, an ancient mosque situated on a disputed land near Lodhi Road in the national capital.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, while hearing a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board challenging the demolition order of the ancient mosque alongside the Link Road in Aliganj village, adjourned the matter to Wednesday after the counsel for the Centre sought time to take instructions.The judge said that he is ready to give as much time as possible but the status should not change.“I will give you as much time as you want, but don’t change the status. We will have it tomorrow, but you should not come tomorrow and say, ‘Sorry, we have demolished the building’. I will then haul up your officials for contempt,” the court remarked during the hearing.The plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, for the Waqf Board, has said that the authorities have asked them to vacate the mosque for its demolition even though the land dispute is pending in the Waqf Tribunal.The petition has also said that the land in question has been occupied for the graveyard and Lal Masjid “since time immemorial”. However, in 2017, the land of the graveyard was taken by the authorities, a dispute which is pending adjudication in the Waqf Tribunal.On Tuesday, appearing for the board, senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose, told the court that the land dispute has been pending since 2017 and has still not been decided because of various problems with the Waqf Tribunal, including the Tribunal stopping work twice due to problems in its constitution.Senior advocate Ghose also said that even though the Tribunal was made functional and appointments were made after court orders, it again stopped operations since December 2020, due to problems in its constitution and a vacancy of two members.He said that the authorities are taking advantage of this situation and on March 31, the SHO of Basti Nizamuddin police station visited the mosque and allegedly said that it will be demolished to use the area for the CRPF canteen, barracks for men and parking of CRPF vehicles, among others. He also allegedly asked the Imam to vacate the mosque.Ghose sought that the Tribunal be constituted and the matter be decided before taking any untoward step.The Delhi government, represented by advocate Jawahar Raja, told the court that the appointment of the members in the Waqf Tribunal will be completed within four weeks. The court took the statement on record and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Civil defence volunteers, civilians clash after car crash, cases filed  New Delhi: Three civil defence volunteers and a civilian were injured, one of them seriously, after a fight ensued between 15 volunteers and a group of motorists and passersby, allegedly over issuing challan for not wearing masks, near the IIT gate in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas on Monday afternoon, police said.Both the groups included women and some of them alleged that they were molested and sexually harassed by the assaulters. Some women civil defence volunteers alleged that apart from indecent behaviour and hurling abusive words, few of the attackers surrounded them and tore their uniforms.Some videos of the clash were circulated on social media, prompting the police to register a cross-first information report (FIR) against the civil defence volunteers and the other party, a few of whom have been identified.According to police, the incident occurred around 3 pm when a group of 15 civil defence volunteers were assisting government officials in prosecuting motorists for not wearing masks at a traffic signal near the IIT gate.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that the traffic signal was green when the volunteers stopped a car to prosecute its occupants for mask violation. The sudden braking caused two cars behind the vehicle to crash into each other.The DCP said the one of the drivers, a 21-year-old college student, was returning home with his aunt and her daughter after visiting a dental clinic in Yusuf Sarai. “He has alleged that one of the volunteers forcibly took out his car’s keys and misbehaved with him. An argument broke out between them and the volunteer attacked him with his belt,” said DCP Thakur, quoting the driver’s complaint.Seeing the driver allegedly being assaulted by the civil defence volunteers, some passersby stopped and joined him in beating up the volunteers. Videos of the purported incident show the volunteers allegedly being chased, kicked, punched and attacked with a helmet as well. While three volunteers received injuries, one of them seriously, in the clash, a civilian was also injured, police said.“All of them were admitted to AIIMS where the seriously injured volunteer is still undergoing treatment. We have registered two separate cases against each group and investigation is underway,” said DCP Thakur.Police have filed both cases under IPC section 308 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).In the case against the volunteers, charges of sexual harassment and molestation have also been added based on the complaint, police officers privy to the development said.Since civil defence comes under the Delhi government’s revenue department, the department has also ordered an inquiry into the incident. “We have asked the local sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report,” said Sanjeev Khirwar, divisional commissioner.

The railway crossing, DDA officials said, is a major traffic choke point.Puri tweeted, “In this era where completion of projects on time is the new norm, I was delighted that the Road Overbridge at Narela for which foundation stone was laid on 29 Dec 2017, was inaugurated today.”The six-lane elevated corridor has been constructed on Urban Extension Road-1, around 2.5 km away from NH-4. This will connect NH-44 (GT Karnal Road) and Bawana-Auchandi Road. Nearly 80,000 vehicles pass through the railway crossing daily.The project, DDA officials said, is crucial for the development of Narela where the land-owning agency has close to 30,000 flats under various stages of construction. DDA is planning to develop Narela as the next sustainable sub-city and is a priority area.“Funds have been allocated for transport infrastructure projects... [like] the DMRC’s Rithala-Narela corridor with Alipur in Narela. We have also allocated funds for the construction of UER –II stretch in Delhi that is being executed by the NHAI,” said a DDA official. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' ‘New curriculum till Class 8 in some east Delhi schools’  The Delhi government is planning to introduce its new curriculum on a pilot basis for students up to Class 8 in its east district’s zone number two schools in July, officials familiar with the development said on Tuesday.The east district’s zone number two has over 60 schools spread across areas such as Mayur Vihar, Trilokpuri, Mandawali, Ashok Nagar, Patparganj, and IP extension, among others.The Delhi government had in last July formed a committee — Delhi Curriculum Reform Committee — for the creation of a new curriculum for children up to the age of 14 years in line with the globally renowned best practices and educational reforms. The committee was mandated to re-imagine the current curriculum, pedagogical practices and provide a roadmap for an innovative, student-friendly module for pre-primary, primary, and upper primary classes in Delhi schools.A senior official of the government’s education department, who wished not to be named, said, “The government has contemplated on piloting the curriculum it is creating from the public schools of a particular zone in east Delhi . The idea behind implementing the curriculum in a pilot way is to figure out what challenges can come and how they can be ironed out.”A member of the curriculum reform committee, also requesting anonymity, said that the project will be implemented on a pilot basis from July onwards in the east Delhi district’s zone-2. “The curriculum is only for students of nursery to Class 8, and therefore it won’t be very challenging to implement. The curriculum is very transformative. It will bring out a very new learning system among the children of Delhi. The committee is meeting on April 8 to discuss further details of its implementation, including training of teachers,” the committee member said.Seema Singh Rathi, principal of Sarvodya Kanya Vidyalaya in Mayur Vihar said, “We have heard that our zone is likely to be the first to implement the Delhi government’s new curriculum. However, we have not received any official communication yet. If implemented, it will be a great opportunity for our teachers and students.”The Delhi government has also announced the implementation of its own education board — known as Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) — in 20-25 schools from this academic session onwards. “The government is yet to finalise the names of the 20-25 schools. However, the new education board will be implemented in schools situated in different districts,” the education department official said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Affluent pockets have high caseload, more hot spots  New Delhi: South Delhi district has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases and micro-containment zones as on April 4, a weekly summary of the cases of the viral infection and the hot spots in the national capital prepared by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) shows.Of the 12,050 total Covid-19 active cases as on April 4 evening, 1,916 were in south Delhi, followed by 1,570 in south-west Delhi and 1,559 each in south-east and north-west districts in the city. The lowest number of cases are in neighbouring districts of northeast Delhi (220) and Shahdara (539), the DDMA report showed.Also, as on April 4 evening, the report showed, of the 3,090 containment zones in the city, 749 were in south Delhi – the highest among the 11 revenue districts.According to Delhi government’s daily bulletin, the total active cases in the capital on Tuesday stood at 17,332. The city reported 5,100 fresh cases on Tuesday -- the highest this year -- which came on the back of 103,453 tests -- the maximum ever.As the Capital faces what experts call a fourth wave of Covid infections, the total number of active cases rose to 17,332 and total number of containment zones to 3,291 on Tuesday, the government’s daily health bulletin said. On Tuesday, the city recorded 5,100 new cases -- the highest daily spike in cases this year.Senior officials in the revenue and health departments said that at this particular juncture, several affluent colonies in the city have a disproportionately high caseload, which also reflects in the high number of micro-containment zones created in these areasDistricts such as south Delhi, south-east Delhi, south-west Delhi and north-west Delhi – which top the list in terms of caseload – have relatively high number of planned colonies, gated communities and high-income localities, compared to districts such as north-east Delhi and Shahdara, which mostly have densely populated low-income group colonies and unplanned neighbourhoods.Some of the localities that have been identified by the DDMA as high caseload areas include Vasant Kunj, Pitampura, Greater Kailash I & II, Dwarka, Rohini, Paschim Vihar, Vasant Vihar, Mukherjee Nagar, RK Puram and Lajpat Nagar, senior officials said, adding that each of these areas have 30 to 70 containment zones. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said the government has scaled up testing and micro-containment efforts in these areas. “Experts have told us that in the previous waves of Covid-19 in the city, the densely populated areas witnessed extremely high caseload. So, the antibody prevalence is likely to be higher in those areas. That is one reason why in this particular wave so far, affluent colonies are witnessing high number of cases.”Rajiv Kakria, member of the residents’ welfare group in Greater Kailash-1, said they were helping the government in efforts to curb the spread of the infection.“In colonies with a high number of cases, resident groups are helping with organising test camps, ensuring delivery of essential goods to doorsteps of home isolated patients, making separate arrangements for garbage collection from residences of patients and conducting awareness camps to boost the vaccination drive.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “The government’s assessment makes sense in this regard. In the previous surge in cases recorded in last November, which was the worst so far, we have seen the virus rage through densely populated neighbourhoods, with disproportionately higher cases emerging in slums, unauthorised colonies and low-income localities. So, at this point of time, the antibody prevalence is likely to be high in such areas. That means, affluent colonies are likely to witness relatively high cases.”More than 56% of the 28,000 people sampled during Delhi’s fifth serological survey in late-January this year were found to have developed antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus.In 2020, Delhi witnessed three distinct phases of severe spikes in Covid-19 cases – in June, September and November. At its worst, the Capital recorded 8,593 new cases in a day on November 11. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics delhi news ',\n",
              " ' Ansari’s wife approaches SC  New DelhiGangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s wife Afshan Ansari has moved the Supreme Court seeking safety for the Mau MLA while he is being shifted to Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh from Rupnagar jail in Punjab, and also during his trial in pending cases in the state. Afshan, alleging imminent threat to Ansari’s life, has sought intervention of the top court to ensure that her husband is not killed in a so-called fake encounter.“The petitioner is in complete fear that now any time an untoward incident can happen to her husband but for protective directions passed by this Hon’ble Court,” Afshan said in her plea.The court is expected to hear her petition on Friday. The petition has cited various attempts to eliminate Ansari over the years and alleged that Brajesh Singh, a mafia don and a former UP BJP MLA, is conspiring to kill Ansari with the state’s support. Earlier, Afshan wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind expressing similar fears and said that her husband was a witness in a murder case in which Singh and one of his accomplices are prime accused.The Supreme Court on March 26 allowed a transfer petition filed by the UP government seeking transfer of Ansari from Ropar jail in Punjab to Banda in UP. Ansari was initially lodged in a jail in UP as an undertrial when the Punjab Police obtained production warrant against him on a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation and brought him to Punjab. As the Punjab government refused to shift Ansari back to UP citing his medical condition -- he is reportedly suffering from hypertension, diabetes, back pain, skin allergy and depression -- the UP government moved the top court, which allowed his transfer by an order last month. A hundred-member team of UP Police was in Punjab on Tuesday to bring Ansari to Banda district jail. They left in the afternoon and were expected to reach Banda by early morning Wednesday. Ansari has to stand trial in at least 14 cases in UP on charges of murder, extortion and under the Gangster Act. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Surge continues, city records 5100 fresh Covid cases  New DelhiThe Covid graph in the city continued its steep upward climb on Tuesday, with the number of daily cases breaching 5,000-mark — first time since November-end . The city on Tuesday recorded 5,100 cases and 17 deaths due to the viral infection, as reported in Delhi’s daily health bulletin. The increase in cases has been sharper during the “fourth wave” – as the Delhi government refers to the current surge, with the numbers rising from under 1,000 to over 5,000 in just 15 days. . Experts, however, say this is the second spike that the city is witnessing.Despite the high number of cases, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – remained below 5% due to the high number of tests conducted. The city reported a positivity rate of 4.93% on Tuesday, with 103,453 test having been conducted the previous day, as per the health bulletin. Tuesday was the first time the city has seen over 100,000 tests in a day. “The number of cases has definitely gone up faster this time around. This is because many people who are positive are moving around and restaurants and gyms are open. Normally, there is a surge in cases within 60 to 100 days of easing of restrictions. This is the natural behaviour of the virus. And, this is likely to continue till April or maybe May,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. He headed Delhi government’s first committee on control and management of Covid-19 cases. He added that the number of cases this time might cross the numbers seen during the peak of November. Delhi had reported 8,593 cases on November 11, the highest till date for the city. In addition to the night curfew, Sarin feels that the restaurants should only open outdoor seating or give takeaways. “Restaurants and bars lead to the spread of the infection; you have to remove your mask if you have to eat or drink. An interesting study from the Columbia district in Washington DC showed that when restaurants were opened up after following strict masking norms, the number of cases increased ten-folds and number of deaths five-fold in 100 days,” he said. The experts said that asymptomatic transmission was a major cause of concern during the current surge. “It has now been established that nearly 60% of the transmission can happen from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Targeting only those with symptoms, such as fever, is not good enough. We need to trace more contacts and quarantine them,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He is currently the chairman PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine. He added, “The pool of people transmitting silently will only increase as more and more people get vaccinated. This is because those who receive even one shot get some amount of immunity and are likely to have milder symptoms. They are also likely to not get tested and hence transmit it on to others.” Dr Sarin agreed, adding, “The antibodies which form after an infection or immunisation are almost same. And, over 50% of Delhi’s population is seropositive. They are moving around and if they get the infection, and they can, they will have mild symptoms and may pass on the infection to others.” Both said there is a need to increase vaccination. With the Centre opening up vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years, Delhi’s drive has picked up pace. A record 87,678 doses were administered on Monday, of which 73% were given at government facilities, said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. As per provisional reports, 74,642 doses were administered on Tuesday. This comes a day after the government announced that at least one-third of the vaccination centres in 33 Delhi government hospitals will run 24*7 Tuesday onwards. “95% of the total slots in government centres were utilised as compared to 67% in private hospitals. The trend was the opposite initially when the vaccination drive had begun. However, people are now happy with the facilities in government centres and are coming there,” said Jain. So far, 1.38 million persons in Delhi have been administered at least one shot of the vaccine. As the cases increase, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has stopped walk-in registrations at its out-patient clinics which had been restarted in December. “To optimise diversion of available manpower and material resources for the care and treatment of … Covid-19 disease, it has been decided to temporarily close down routine walk-in OPD … registrations,” read an order from the medical superintendent of the hospital. The clinics will continue to follow up with their existing patients. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' NIA to question DCP-rank officer in Hiran murder case  Mumbai: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will question a deputy commissioner of police (DCP)-rank officer of the Mumbai Crime Branch who allegedly visited the crime intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3, when Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran – whose body was found from a Mumbra creek – was present at then CIU chief Sachin Vaze’s office.Vaze was arrested by NIA on March 13 for allegedly planting a vehicle with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threat letter near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia in February. Hiran was linked to the vehicle.“The agency wanted to verify certain details with all the people concerned in the case who were present at CIU office when Hiran had met Vaze. The agency will verify details and examine the facts,” an NIA officer said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.However, a senior Mumbai Police officer contended that the DCP in question visited the CIU office for some other work, and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.NIA has so far recorded the statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in the Antilia explosives scare, as well as Hiran’s death case, added the NIA officer.On Monday at 11.40pm, a group of eight to 10 NIA officers – while recreating the crime scene in the Hiran death case – took Vaze to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT, former Victoria Terminus) after they found during investigation that the suspended cop had taken a train from there to Kalwa station on March 4, the day Hiran went missing. A team from Pune’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CSFL) was also present when the crime scene was recreated, and recorded a video of Vaze walking on platform number 4, from where he’d boarded a train around 7pm on March 4.Hiran was allegedly murdered on March 4, and his body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) was investigating the Hiran murder case before it was handed over to NIA.During its probe, ATS found that Vaze got off at Kalwa railway station and had allegedly contacted Hiran around 8.30pm. They spoke for around 11 minutes, and Vaze allegedly asked him to meet near Ghodbunder Road. However, he requested Hiran to tell his family that he was going to meet an officer named Tawade from Kandivli police station.On Monday, NIA officers also took Vaze to Kalwa railway station, where he was made to walk from the platform to the station’s exit. The agency has also taken custody of the CCTV footage of CSMT and Kalwa station, said the officer cited above.NIA seized a high-end motorcycle linked to the case from Daman on Monday. A Benelli DSK TNT 600GT, it was registered in Thane in the name of a woman suspected to be close to Vaze. She was seen in a CCTV grab while entering a five-star hotel at south Mumbai where Vaze was staying between February 16 and February 20. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Deshmukh, Maha govt move SC against HC’s order for CBI probe  A day after resigning as Maharashtra’s home minister, Anil Deshmukh moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday and said that the Bombay high court order for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of extortion against him “impacts the federal structure”, and could lead to a “biased investigation”, apart from destabilising the state government.The Maharashtra government also filed a separate petition in the apex court against the Monday order by the high court, complaining that the CBI investigation was ordered without any fact or formal pleadings and that the central agency was roped in without letting the state agencies first conduct their investigation.The CBI has registered a preliminary inquiry to investigate allegations against Deshmukh after the Bombay high court order, people familiar with the matter said late on Tuesday.The high court’s decision to allow the CBI inquiry came after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh asked policemen, including suspended officer Sachin Vaze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants, and other sources. The allegations followed drama over police investigations into the discovery of an explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the alleged murder of a man linked to the car.On Tuesday, the Maharashtra government argued out that the state, for valid reasons, has already withdrawn its general consent to the CBI to carry out investigations in Maharashtra, and that the high court should have remained mindful of this aspect before ordering the probe.While the two petitions were filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Singh -- whose accusations and a petition before the high court led to the preliminary inquiry by CBI -- and another petitioner before the high court , Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, have also filed their caveat in the apex court to ensure no order is passed without hearing them. The petitions are yet to be assigned a date of hearing.Deshmukh resigned on Monday, hours after the order by the high court asking CBI to conclude a preliminary inquiry within 15 days, making him the most high-profile casualty so far in the twists and turns over the discovery of the explosives and the death of Mansukh Hiran.As the row reached the Supreme Court, Nationalist Congress Party leader Deshmukh emphasised that the high court, relying on certain unsubstantiated allegations by Singh, entrusted the probe to an agency “which the state government has the least confidence in”, and that “such processes may well be followed to destabilise the government”.“In the annals of judicial history, there has hardly been an occasion when the court has taken the statement made against a sitting minister at face value and proceeded to direct an outside agency, without calling from for a response from the concerned minister, to conduct a preliminary inquiry,” said Deshmukh’s plea, filed through advocate Sudhanshu S Choudhri. The petition, which HT has seen, was settled by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is expected to represent Deshmukh in the apex court.Questioning the credentials of CBI, Deshmukh added that, presently, the agency was also being led by an interim director, and the legality of this ad hoc arrangement was already questioned before the Supreme Court.He said that the high court should have given sufficient time to the state agencies to carry out the probe at the first instance and only in the case of any lapse should a probe, preferably by a team of officers nominated by the court under its supervision, have been contemplated. But the investigation was handed over to an agency “under the control of the central government”, he added.“The court chose not to follow that procedure, thereby showing utter lack of confidence in the state machinery as if every investigating officer lacked the confidence of the court in conducting a fair and impartial inquiry,” read Deshmukh’s petition, which added that this assumption was “unsustainable and without any demonstrable reason”.Requesting the court to stay the order, the petition said the chief reason cited by the high court for a CBI probe was that Deshmukh served as the home minister, but now that he has resigned, the state machinery must be allowed to freely conduct its investigation.The state government, in its appeal, highlighted that Maharashtra had already ordered a judicial probe into the allegations on March 30 by retired Bombay HC judge KU Chandiwal and that the high court could not have straightaway passed the order of a CBI probe without examining the formal pleadings and submissions of the state.The state’s petition added that the accusations by Singh were unsubstantiated and that there was no justification to hand over the probe to the CBI, whose jurisdiction had been ousted by the Maharashtra government by withdrawing its general consent. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi is expected to argue for the state government’s petition.Singh first approached the Supreme Court for a CBI probe but was asked to go to the Bombay HC at the first instance. Apart from him, a bunch of public interest litigations were also filed in the high court, which on Monday ordered CBI to complete a preliminary inquiry within 15 days and thereafter proceed in accordance with the legal procedure.

              " \" Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's supporters denied prison visit and detained  Supporters of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were detained Tuesday outside a penal colony east of Moscow where the Kremlin critic is currently serving time.Navalny has been on hunger strike for nearly a week to protest what he says is the failure of authorities to provide proper medical treatment for his back and leg pains.Doctors from the Navalny-backed Alliance of Doctors union and supporters of the politician gathered in front of the prison. Navalny's physician and the union leader Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva tried to get inside to meet with prison officials and see Navalny or talk to the prison medics about his condition, but were turned away.Local police said they detained nine people who allegedly “breached public order.” They included Vasilyeva and a CNN crew. Vasilyeva and the journalists were soon released, while other members of the union remained in custody.Navalny, 44, is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest domestic opponent. He was arrested in January upon returning to Moscow from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.A court ordered Navalny in February to serve 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation, including when he was convalescing in Germany, from a 2014 embezzlement conviction. Navalny has rejected the conviction as fabricated, and the European Сourt of Human Rights found it “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”Authorities transferred Navalny last month from a Moscow jail to the IK-2 penal colony in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of the Russian capital. The facility in the town of Pokrov stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its especially strict inmate routines, which include standing at attention for hours.Within weeks of being imprisoned, Navalny said he developed severe back and leg pains and was effectively deprived of sleep because a guard checks on him hourly at night. He went on a hunger strike last Wednesday, demanding access to proper medication and a visit from his doctor.Russia's state penitentiary service has said Navalny is receiving all the medical help he needs, but Vasilyeva and others from the Alliance of Doctors had vowed to go to the prison on Tuesday if the politician wasn't allowed a visit from a qualified independent physician by Monday night.“We're gathering there not to protest. We're gathering there to save a man who, like any one of us, has the right to life and health,” Vasilyeva said in a YouTube video Monday.In an Instagram post Monday, Navalny said that three of the 15 people he is housed with were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He said he had a strong cough and a fever with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 F).The newspaper Izvestia carried a statement from the state penitentiary service late Monday saying Navalny had been the prison's sanitary unit after a checkup found him having “signs of a respiratory illness, including a high fever.”It was unclear Tuesday whether there had been any changes to the politician's condition.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Navalny would receive the necessary medical care but no preferential treatment.“Of course, there can be no talk about special conditions for one of the convicted persons,” Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. “There are certain rules for inmates who get sick. If the illness truly takes place, any relevant treatment will be provided.”Vasilyeva from the Alliance of Doctors said Tuesday she and her colleagues will keep coming to the colony. “I see only one option. If nothing happens, then we will come here tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. We will keep coming with our colleagues, requesting information and (trying to) be involved in (Navalny's) treatment somehow,” Vasilyeva said. “We can't back down. It's a matter of a person's life and death.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics alexei navalny \",\n",
              " ' Uttar Pradesh takes over Mukhtar Ansari’s custody from Punjab  Chandigarh/Lucknow A team of at least 100 officials of the Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday took custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from the Punjab police.Officials at the Central jail in Punjab’s Ropar handed over the Bahujan Samaj Party’s Mau MLA to the police team from UP’s Banda, led by deputy superintendent of police Satya Prakash, after a team of doctors examined Ansari.A senior official said Ansari was handed over to the UP police at around 2.10 pm on Tuesday and the contingent is likely to reach Banda by Wednesday morning.UP police, equipped with sophisticated weapons, are bringing Ansari back to the state in an anti-riot vehicle, Vajra.The action has come after the Supreme Court directed Punjab to grant Ansari’s custody to UP after the Yogi Adityanath-led government in the state moved the top court against the Punjab government’s refusal to transfer him.Ansari has been lodged in Ropar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.The official said that all security measures have been employed to ensure Ansari’s safe transfer after a Special Task Force from UP was assigned to chalk out a route plan. Other prisons in UP have also been asked to prepare in case of any last-minute changes due to security reasons.Banda jailor Pramod Tiwari said all security arrangements in the jail have been beefed up.“Security personnel have been posted inside as well as outside the jail premises. In barrack number 15, where Mukhtar Ansari will be kept, arrangements of light, drinking water and cleanliness have been spruced up,” news agency PTI quoted Tiwari as saying.On March 26, the top court directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues. The court directed that Ansari’s custody be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda district jail in the state.The BJP-run Uttar Pradesh government accused the Congress government in Punjab of “shielding” Ansari by not letting the state take custody.The apex court also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in various cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, lodged in Uttar Pradesh. Out of these, 10 cases were at trial stage.In a related development, Ropar senior superintendent of police Akhil Chaudhary has ordered a probe into the circumstances under which an ambulance, ferrying Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court on March 31, was found abandoned near Nanak Dhaba in village Khwaspura fallinder Sadar Police Station of Ropar.A case was registered in Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki after the documents of the ambulance were found to be fake and one person was arrested on Monday.

              " ' Barabanki police seize ambulance, get tech examination done  LUCKNOW The Barabanki district police on Tuesday got a technical examination done of the luxury ambulance used by Mafioso-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari to appear in Mohali court earlier on April 1, said additional director general (ADG), Lucknow zone, SN Sabat.He said the names of Ansari and his aides had been added in the investigation as per the findings and statements recorded so far. The ADG himself visited Barabanki to examine the ambulance brought back from Ropar, Punjab, where it was found abandoned near a roadside eating joint on the Chandigarh-Nagal highway on Sunday evening.He said a team of road transport office and local police had got the technical examination done of the ambulance to find out what changes had been done in it violating the norms.He said the charges will be increased in the FIR lodged previously in this connection. Sabat said the private ambulance bearing a registration number of UP’s Barabanki was reportedly registered on the basis of a fake identity card of Mau resident Dr Alka Rai since December 2013. In the matter, the FIR was initially lodged with the city kotwali police of Barabanki district on the complaint of Barabanki assistant road transport officer (ARTO) Pankaj Singh.Dr Rai, the owner of a private hospital in Mau, had informed the police that she had no connection with Barabanki and had never set up any hospital there. She also claimed to have no idea how the ambulance was registered in her name in Barabanki. Earlier, the team had examined her signatures and matched them with those on the registration documents of the ambulance. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Fed up with smart meters, Over 6,000 power consumers say no to power’  As many as 6,615 power consumers using smart meters have got their electricity connections snapped permanently till April 2021 even as the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) plans to install smart meters in all consumers’ houses.“As many as 1,440 smart meter consumers opted for disconnection of their electricity connection in December 2020 and this number rose to 6,615 till April end this year,” people dealing with the issue said.“Among them 1,320 are in Lucknow, 782 in Mathura, 542 in Varanasi, 1409 in Meerut, 136 in Allahabad, 112 in Gorakhpur, 233 in Bareilly and 1,205 in Kanpur,” they added.Smart meters have courted controversies in UP with energy minister Shrikant Sharma himself having raised questions over their quality and functioning from time to time.UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad chairman Avadhesh Kumar Verma said that more and more smart meter consumers were opting for snapping of their power connections because of the harassment they face on account of smart meters. He said at a time when the Central government was planning 100% coverage of consumers with prepaid meters by 2024, power consumers were anxious to get rid of smart meters and this was a serious issue.“Today, I have a discussion over phone with Union power secretary Alok Kumar and I urged him to ensure that prepaid meters that the Centre was planning to install were not based on the same technology because this was necessary to win consumers’ trust otherwise the project would not succeed,” said Verma, who is also state advisory committee member.

              " ' Panchayat polls: BJP releases second list  LUCKNOW: Days after revealing its first cut of candidates, which was a mix of various caste groups and in some cases having representation from Muslim minorities too, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared the second list of candidates for the three-tier panchayat polls on Tuesday, much on the lines of how it releases lists for assembly and Lok Sabha polls. Like in bigger polls, the BJP leadership discussed names of candidates for these rural polls too and then the lists were officially released by the party. Immediately after the release, its leaders tasked with panchayat polls cheered up the cadre, saying their political opponents were trapped in internal dissension as well as confusion over candidate selection for the rural elections. “Many are seeing these polls as a semi-final ahead of 2022 UP polls. But people forget we have won all the polls since 2014 Lok Sabha polls,” the UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev said, emphasising on party’s preparedness While the BJP officially released lists of candidates for 18 districts, including key ones like Rampur, Rae Bareli, Sant Kabir Nagar and Bhadohi on Friday last itself, on Tuesday it released the lists for Azamgarh, Maharajganj, Etawah and Lalitpur. “Had it not been for fresh covid surge, we had planned some big rallies in villages. Now, of course, the campaign would be held in keeping with the covid protocol. The opposition appears to be nowhere in the race,” the party leaders have been telling the cadres in their regular briefings. Like the Samajwadi Party, the BSP too didn’t officially release candidate lists even as the BJP accused the Congress of not being able to find enough candidates for these polls even in Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, a point that has been finding regular mention in all BJP campaign related to these polls. The BJP campaign is mostly centered around how the farm laws are beneficial for the farmers and that the party leadership is open to farmers’ concerns and willing to make changes in the farm laws. Other parts of the campaign include a publicity brochure containing various schemes initiated for the poor. Privately, BJP leaders admit that at many places they expect a BJP vs SP contest in the state’s countryside where several political parties, new to the state, too are trying their luck. These include parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, which are looking at these rural polls as a chance to test the water before deciding whether to contest the 2022 UP assembly polls that would follow soon after these polls. However, it is the BJP that has declared maximum candidates so far and hasn’t witnessed any major bickering, barring the one in Jhansi when its district chief had to beat a hasty retreat amid protest by local cadres. Having decided on a phased announcement of candidates, and having built considerable hype around these rural polls, the party’s first list of announcements made on Friday, even contained districts that go to polls in the second phase. “That shows our planning. Chitrakoot and Kannauj will go to polls in the second phase and yet, we announced them. We also named candidates for 52 wards of Rae Bareli. How many has Congress named,” asked BJP lawmaker Vijay Bahadur Pathak, the party’s UP in-charge for panchayat polls. In certain districts like Kannauj and Ghaziabad, the BJP, accused of not fielding many Muslim candidates, has also fielded candidates from the community. Lalji Verma, BSP’s legislature party leader in UP Assembly, however, dismissed BJP’s claim of being well prepared. “BJP is the ruling party and naturally is ‘well prepared’. If they are so confident, they should have contested the elections to the post of pradhan (village head) and block development council (BDC) member on their ticket,” said Verma.

The first six days of the month reported 485 cases, almost 81 cases a day, and two deaths.The disease spread seemed to have been in control since December last year with no death reported since January 5.With Uttar Pradesh not showing any signs of a lockdown till now, unlike Delhi and Maharashtra, district magistrate (DM) Suhas LY said the main aim of the administration was to reduce keep the case fatality rate (CFR) from rising, while simultaneously increasing testing.“We are worried with this sudden surge in new cases this month. To check the spread, besides adapting the ‘track, test and treat’ methodology, we have also started focussing on contact tracing. A 10-member contact tracing team, on Tuesday, traced at least 25 primary and secondary contacts of 93 infected patients. The RT-PCR samples of all the contacts have been taken and the health officials will reason out the cause of sudden spike in active cases on the basis of their reports,” he said.The DM said that besides proper sanitization in containment zones, they have begun thorough checking of industrial units. “Stern action will be taken against those commercial and industrial units disobeying standard Covid-19 protocol within their premises. This decision has been taken in view of the large number of workers coming from different areas,” he said.He also said that the district administration has also issued advisories for factories and other industrial establishments to strictly follow safety protocols. “Six teams, with the help of district industries department, have been constituted to inspect whether safety protocols are being followed in workplaces and factories.

The ADM (sadar), who is also the incident commander of that area, has issued a show-cause to the factory owner. If the reply will not be satisfactory, action against the owner will be taken as per the provisions of Pandemic Act, 1997 and section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code,” Suhas said.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said daily testing has been increased and rapid antigen kit testing camps are being organised regularly at different places in the district. “The district has stepped up monitoring of patients in home isolation.

              " ' Bengal Polls: PM Modi targets Mamata over appeal to Muslim voters, CM hits back  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit out at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her appeal to Muslim voters in the state to unite against the Bharatiya Janata Party, even as the Trinamool Congress supremo alleged that the BJP was threatening people to vote in its favor.The state’s 31 constituencies constituency voted in the third phase on Tuesday.Addressing a rally in North Bengal, the PM said, “If I had urged Hindus to unite and vote for BJP, the ECI would have sent me 8 – 10 notices. The poll panel sends notices to the Prime Ministers too. It would have made front-page news and all sorts of editorial pieces would have been written to tear me apart. I don’t know whether the ECI has sent any notice to Didi.”The PM was referring to Banerjee’s remarks ahead of the third phase where she urged the Muslim voters to not vote for the BJP.“A friend of BJP has come from Hyderabad. Along with a boy from Furfura Sharif he is spending crores of rupees and giving communal slogans. They are not only trying to divide Hindus and Muslims, but even attempting to split the Muslim votes. Don’t cast your vote for them because that would go to the BJP,” Banerjee had said on Saturday while addressing a rally in South 24 Parganas.Of the total 294 constituencies in the state, 125 have a significant Muslim population.“This proves that the people you had relied upon to win the elections have abandoned you and you are now publicly urging Muslims to unite and vote for you and save you,” Modi said.According to the last Census, Muslims account for 27% of the state’s population. The community has traditionally voted for the Left and switched to the TMC in the last few elections. In the 2016 assembly polls, TMC, which won 211 of the 294 seats, won 90 seats in Muslim-dominated constituencies.The PM also hit out at TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee, who is the CM’s nephew. “Didi has introduced a new tax – Bhaipo Service Tax. The poor daughters and sisters of Bengal saved their hard earned money, which went towards Bhaipo Service Tax. The youth of Bengal is yearning for every single penny and there ₹35 – ₹40 crore are coming in a month. That’s why there is a slogan coming up from every corner of Bengal – Chalo Paltai (lets change),” he said.On Sunday, the BJP released a purported audio clip of a conversation between Kolkata-based businessman Ganesh Bagaria and absconding TMC leader Vinay Mishra, both of whom are suspects in the coal smuggling case. In the audio clip, one man could be heard saying that the money from the coal scam went to Abhishek Banerjee. HT could not independently verify the videos. The TMC has refuted the allegations.The chief minister, meanwhile, alleged that BJP activists were occupying polling booths and attacking TMC candidates. “Only those party workers would be made polling agents who would not be afraid of the BJP. Even today (in the third phase polls) some agents fled after being threatened by BJP. TMC would reward those party workers who are not afraid of BJP,” she said at a public meeting here in Alipurduar district.The TMC supremo said her party’s nominee in Arambagh, Sujata Mondal, was chased and hit on head near a polling booth by BJP workers. “They have inflicted serious injury on our Scheduled Caste candidate Sujata, when she visited a booth. They also hit another candidate in Khanakul. In Canning East, security forces prevented our nominee Shaukat Mollah from entering a booth. There had been numerous such instances of attack on our candidates, party workers across the state,” Banerjee said.The CM further stated that she has received at least 100 complaints of assault and violence since the voted began on Tuesday, and the EC has been duly informed but to no avail.Earlier in the day, the TMC chief tweeted that the BJP was misusing central forces to threaten people to vote in BJP’s favour.“The blatant misuse of Central forces continues unabated. Despite us repeatedly raising this issue, @ECISVEEP continues to be a mute spectator while men in uniform are being misused at several places to openly intimidate TMC voters & influence many to vote in favour of one party,” the CM said in a tweet.Reiterating her allegations at a rally in Cooch Behar, she said, “We have lodged several FIR against the CRPF. We will lodge FIR against the commandants and take legal action. Everyone has the right to move the ECI.”Alleging that the BJP leadership after experiencing a “poor turnout” in rallies has conspired against the TMC, Banerjee said, “Security forces have been asked not to resist booth capturing. Four of our activists have been murdered since the elections began, but no action has been taken. But you (BJP) cannot terrorise us, intimidate us by such acts.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics narendra modi mamata banerjee ',\n",
              " ' EVMs found at TMC leader’s house, 5 officials suspended  The Election Commission of India on Tuesday suspended at least five poll officials after three Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and four Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) were found at a booth-level Trinamool Congress leader’s house in Uluberia Uttar in Howrah district, hours before voting began for the third phase.“We have already suspended the sector officer, two assistant sector officers and a sector police personnel in this regard. Three home guards were demobilised. Even though the machines were kept as reserve, they were immediately replaced with new ones. The seals were intact. All the candidates were informed that the EVMs won’t be used in the poll process,” said a senior official of ECI.Assembly elections were held in 31 constituencies in the third phase on Tuesday across three districts -- Howrah, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas.The sector officer Tapan Sarkar claimed that they did not know that it was the house of a political leader, Goutam Ghosh affiliated to TMC and had only gone there to refresh themselves.“My assistant sector officers and I were tired as we had been travelling from booth to booth on Monday. Around 1 am on Tuesday, when we reached the sector office, we found all rooms occupied. We were asked to spend the night in the car. One of my assistant sector officers said that he knew a person in that area and we can go to his house to rest before joining the poll duty from 4 am. We never knew he was a TMC leader...It was my fault and I accept it. I have been associated with polling duty for many years but really don’t know how I committed this mistake,” Sarkar told reporters.The Bharatiya Janata Party, however, alleged that as the sector officers were state government officials they took the EVMs and VVPATs to rig the machines.“The EVMs and VVPAT machines were found in the house of Goutam Ghosh, who happens to be the TMC booth president. A few villagers saw two vehicles outside the leader’s house and enquired. When they came to know that the sector officer has come, they informed me,” said Chiran Bera, the BJP’s candidate at Uluberia Uttar.Incumbent MLA and TMC candidate Nirmal Maji refused to comment on the issue on the issue.The BJP demanded an independent inquiry into the incident. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said it was a serious matter. “And this becomes more serious that the machines were brought by a car which was on election duty. There should be full-fledged inquiry in this matter and we are sure that the Election Commission will do a separate and independent inquiry,” he said.The incident is similar to one on April 2, when EC suspended four poll officials for using a BJP leader’s vehicle to take EVMs and VVPATs to the strong room in a constituency in Assam, with the one difference being that in that case, the event happened after voting.

The teams will take up a review of testing and treatment facilities in the respective districts, officials said. According to the state’s daily Covid-19 bulletin released on Tuesday, the districts of Ghaziabad and GB Nagar have 410 and 579 active cases, respectively, while two deaths due to Covid-19 have also taken place in GB Nagar in the past two days. Overall, there were 5,928 fresh cases on Tuesday in the state, showed the data. “The chief minister has directed that special teams, which include special secretary rank officers and other officers from the health and medical education departments, to be sent to the districts having high caseload. These include districts like Lucknow, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, GB Nagar, Bareilly, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Jhansi, among others,” said Navneet Sehgal, UP’s additional chief secretary (information). “The teams will take a review of testing and treatment facilities and about the preparations being made by the respective districts. They will also ensure that the best treatment and facilities available are given to the Covid-19 patients,” he added. In Ghaziabad, the sample positivity rate has spiked over 1% in April and stands at 1.36% in first five days with 324 positive reports resulting out of total 23,878 reports. The last time sample positivity rate had gone over 1% was in December 2020 when it was 2.99% (3,034 positive reports of 101,496 total reports). The positivity rates had, however, remained below 1% in the months of January (0.74%), February (0.31%) and March (0.69%) this year. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes, patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than total positive cases, the officials explained. “We have special surveillance drives taken up in high caseload residential areas. Besides, our teams are working to take up testing, contact tracing and allocation of facility for Covid patients. We have also directed hospitals to be ready and arrange sufficient number of beds in order to deal with a surge in Covid cases. In our district, the situation is under control and we are geared up to deal with any upsurge,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. In terms of number of Covid cases, the district during first five days of April has witnessed 256 news cases with 42 in residential segment of Carte (comprising localities like Shastri Nagar), 37 in Indirapuram, 32 in Sahibabad, 34 in Vaishali and 15 in Vasundhara, among others. In the month of March, the district had registered a total of 565 cases. Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar, said that the positivity rate has risen in GB Nagar as well. “The state government had sent a team last year. We will be taking up review with the special team arriving this year too. It will be better in terms of forming strategy and deal with fresh Covid upsurge,” he added. In its April 3 order, the state government issued guidelines for identification of containment zones in residential areas and group housing societies, but did not put any restriction on movement of people in a containment zone. Experts said that movement of people will have to be restricted to check the spread of infection. “If there is no restriction on movement of people in and out of containment zones, it is of no use. At present, we are not seeing much of enforcement against people not wearing mask and not maintaining social distancing,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association -- Ghaziabad.

              " ' Pests enter homes, say residents of Vasundhara  Ghaziabad: With the Covid-19 pandemic already making lives difficult, residents of Ghaziabad’s Vasundhara are now confronted with another challenge – pests.According to residents, seasonal pests like mealybugs and other insects have swarmed the area in strength. The bugs, which are confined mostly to trees, especially mango trees, are also entering their homes pointing to proliferation, they said. Mealybugs are small, white, un-armoured insects that spread during the warmer seasons and act as pests to the vegetation.“We have been facing this issue for the past few weeks. We would see these bugs in the nearby parks and trees every year in this season, but this time their population has boosted a lot. We can even spot them in our houses now. Our sector is greener than others, with several trees, as compared to other sectors, which perhaps could be why we are faced with this menace. What makes it worse is that that very little has been done about the issue,” said Anjani Prasad, a resident of Block B, Vasundhara.Another resident stated that after people started raising the issue, pesticide was sprayed about a week ago but its effect soon wore out.“This year we are seeing more insects in our neighbourhood, especially the small, white mealybugs. A week back, one worker from the civic agency was sent who tried to spray pesticides on these bugs but the effect wore out fast and these bugs started to increase in numbers again. We can see them everywhere now,” said G Suryanarain Rao, another resident of Block B.“These small, white insects have spread all over the area and a single spray of pesticide seems to be ineffective,” said Rajnesh Nautiya, another local.Meanwhile, officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) said that they were unaware of the issue and will look into the matter.“I have not received any such complaint or seen any such issue. The matter concerns the health department,” said Sumit Kumar Rai, zonal officer, Vasundhara, GMC.The corporation’s health official said that they will look into the matter.“The insects are seasonal, though we have not received any specific complaint yet, at least not to my knowledge. But we will look into the matter and get it resolved,” said Dr Mithlesh Kumar, heath officer, GMC. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Man bludgeons brother-in-law to death with grinding stone, arrested  A 35-year-old man was arrested for allegedly bludgeoning his brother-in-law to death with a grinding stone in Sector 47 on March 27. The suspect, identified as Jahrul alias Chhotu of West Bengal, worked as a construction supervisor and lived in a rented accommodation in Sector 46. Police identified the victim as 30-year-old Shaheen Nur Miyan. Assistant commissioner of police Preet Pal Sangwan said that Chhotu worked with the victim and had recently made a profit of ₹4 lakh from a construction project. Police said Chhotu gave the money to his wife but after an argument broke out between the couple in January-end, she took the money and left for her village in West Bengal along with her brother. Despite trying for three months, police said the woman refused to return the money to Chhotu. His brother-in-law also refused to intervene and even stopped talking to him.Sangwan said on March 27, Chhotu called his brother-in-law for drinks at a ground in Sector 47. After a few drinks, the suspect questioned him about his wife, only to be allegedly told that she wouldn’t come to back to him or return his money.“The victim had told the suspect that his sister had spent nearly ₹1 lakh and given him his share of ₹1.25 lakh. He also made fun of the suspect and said he deserved to live without his wife and money as he often fought with her. The deceased started laughing, following which the suspect got furious. He picked up a grinding stone lying near the spot and smashed his face and head repeatedly,” said Sangwan. He then allegedly hid the stone near the spot and fled from the ground. “Fearing police action, Chhotu did not return to his rented room and was living at different areas,” said Sangwan. A driver who used to park his car in the ground informed police control room that a body was lying in a pool of blood, following which a team reached the spot and found a mobile phone ringing at the spot. Police informed the victim’s wife and asked her to identify the body. A case of murder was registered at Sadar police station on March 28 and police arrested the suspect, who had boarded a bus from Iffco Chowk for Delhi, on Monday.Police said they recovered the stone from the spot and he was taken on a two-day police remand for further investigation.

Setting a September 2021 deadline for the same, officials familiar with the matter said they will offer subsidies and scrap costs to vehicle owners for easily procuring e-rickshaws.Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram, said a decision was taken to scrap old diesel auto-rickshaws as these were found plying despite being banned. “The decision to phase out the pollution-emitting auto-rickshaws was taken because of the growing contamination of ambient air, which has deteriorated to the worst level in the city,” said Yadav.Officials said that replacing diesel auto-rickshaws is important to ensure better air quality, as such vehicles severely impact the air quality, especially during winter, when the situation is compounded by falling temperatures and fog. Currently, 50,000 diesel auto-rickshaws are plying on the city roads, of which around 12,000 are older than 10 years. However, the RTA could not provide information on the number of e-rickshaws currently operational in the city.“The commuters will not be hit by this decision as we are not only phasing out diesel auto-rickshaws but also replacing them with e-rickshaws so that last-mile connectivity is not affected,” Yadav said.However, experts expressed concern over diminishing last-mile connectivity options, as the city is heavily reliant on the shared diesel auto-rickshaws, which are easily accessible and cost comparatively much less than cab services or private auto-rickshaws.Sewa Ram, head of the department of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Delhi, said that it is a good decision to introduce e-rickshaws provided they are integrated with the bus connectivity so that people do not have to bargain and pay digitally once they step out of the bus.“The department has to ensure the last-mile connectivity is in place and the fares are fixed. The facility should be from point to point so that the drivers cannot deny passengers any route. There should be two models, one which is driven at a fixed speed and only four people can board, and another where speed is not a constrain,” he said.He said that e-rickshaw rides will cost commuters more than diesel auto-rickshaw rides, as an e-rickshaw can only accommodate four passengers, compared to eight in diesel auto-rickshaws. Also, there will be problems if e-rickshaw drivers refuse long commutes and that the onus is on the authorities to ensure this does not happen.Officials familiar with the matter said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will inaugurate the e-rickshaws on April 9 in the city.“The process of registration and driving licence for these e-rickshaws will be done on priority at the RTA office. We will provide e-rickshaw owners registration certificates within 72 hours of applying. Charging stations have already been set up and more will be put up according to the rising demand. We are helping drivers with the chief minister’s subsidy and MCG subsidy along with ₹12,000 from scrap. Finance schemes have been worked out so that drivers hardly need to pay any extra amount,” Yadav said.Yadav said that more than 100 charging stations have been set up in Udyog Vihar, South City and Golf Course Road.Palash Roy Chowdhury, co-founder, chairman and managing director of SmartE, an e-rickshaw manufacturer that has tied up with the RTA, said, “The project will provide safe, convenient and affordable last-mile services to citizens of the Millennium City while increasing the daily earning of the drivers. Plus, it will save tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions.”Chowdhury said that an electric vehicle will cost nearly ₹1.75 lakh, including registration cost. He said that a finance scheme was worked out, wherein a driver can ₹400- ₹450 per day.Auto-rickshaw drivers, however, were unhappy with the move and said they will not invest in e-rickshaws as they are not confident that the department will set up enough charging stations. They alleged that auto-rickshaw stands that were promised long ago are yet to be created and that the move is an eyewash.Yogesh Sharma, the state general secretary of the Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan, said e-rickshaws are not a feasible option as they are not suitable for long distances. “This e-rickshaw will be used for a short distance and if any passenger wants to go to Manesar, it will take more than three hours in these rickshaws,” he said, adding that they are not supporting this initiative and it is not welcomed by the drivers.

              " ' MCG to introduce 2,000 e-rickshaws, will hold meeting with owners of diesel autos  The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), in a bid to check pollution levels and phase out diesel vehicles, will introduce 2,000 e-rickshaws in Gurugram, officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, even as the road transport authority (RTA) announced an initiative to replace banned diesel auto-rickshaws older than 10 years with e-rickshaws.The MCG’s executive engineer, Devender Bhadana, said that the civic body will hold a meeting with diesel autorickshaw owners and drivers at the John Hall in Civil Lines on Wednesday. They will be sensitised about the environmental harms caused by operating diesel auto-rickshaws and will be explained the MCG’s policy, including monetary aids, for switching to e-rickshaws.MCG officials said that traffic police and RTA officials will also attend the meeting. “The main purpose of the meeting is for generating awareness among diesel auto-rickshaw owners and drivers. The MCG will explain to them the environmental damages caused through running auto-rickshaws on diesel and the long-term economic benefits of e-rickshaws due to considerable lower running and maintenance costs,” said Bhadana.Bhadana said that the MCG will be providing a grant of around ₹50,000 to diesel auto-rickshaw drivers and owners, while around ₹30,000 will be given as scrap costs, provided the diesel auto-rickshaw is scrapped by an agency authorised by the Haryana government.“The purchaser concerned can procure any e-rickshaw of their choice. We are aiming to launch all 2,000 e-rickshaws within the next three months,” said Bhadana, adding that the RTA will provide e-rickshaw owners registration certificates (RC) within 72 hours of applying.Bhadana said that the MCG will be the regulatory body for all the 2,000 e-rickshaws and will also determine a fixed fare, based on point-to-point distances.Bhadana said that the MCG has also finalised a contractor for assisting diesel auto-rickshaw drivers and owners with all the necessary documentation to procure loans for purchasing e-rickshaws.In September last year, HT had reported that the MCG floated a tender to select a contractor for this task and that the civic body is looking to introduce 2,000 new e-rickshaws in the city. MCG officials said that the 2,000 e-rickshaws are being launched in the first phase of the project and once the conversion figure is attained, they will roll out 5,000 more e-rickshaws.In September 2016, the then MCG additional commissioner, Amit Khatri, came up with a plan of launching 1,000 app-based e-rickshaws in the city along with an app-based company for last-mile connectivity to residents from areas located near rapid metro stations.This plan, however, never came to fruition, and the same company launched 500 e-rickshaws a year later at stations of the Delhi Metro in the city.MCG officials privy to the matter said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar may also launch a batch of new e-rickshaws in the city on Friday, as the RTA seeks to replace banned autos with e-rickshaws.

              " ' Flyover at Bakhtawar Chowk to smoothen traffic flow  The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to construct a flyover at Bakhtawar Chowk, one of the busiest intersections in the city, officials said on Tuesday. A detailed report in this regard will be tabled for approval during the eighth GMDA meeting, scheduled for April 9. Officials said that the flyover will be constructed on the sector-dividing road, between Huda City Centre and Subhash Chowk. “We have made a proposal with detailed report for constructing a flyover at the Bakhtawar Chowk, which will help in managing traffic and ease the vehicular congestion at the intersection. The flyover, which will be around 500-600 metres long, will be made in the direction of Subhash Chowk, towards Huda City Centre, passing over the intersection,” said a senior GMDA official, requesting anonymity. Traffic from Rajiv Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Huda City Centre and Mayfield Gardens converge at Bakhtawar Chowk, making it one of the most congested spots in the city. As per GMDA’s own comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) compiled by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), the junction has a vehicle accumulation count of 8,545 between 6pm and 7pm.As per the CMP, roads leading from Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre, running west to east, have six lanes, with service roads on both sides and a right-of-way of 60 metres. However, the roads leading from Rajiv Chowk and Mayfield Gardens, running north to south, have four lanes, with a right-of-way ranging from 30-36 metres. Due to the differences in the width of carriageways, the junction is not aligned. As a result, it takes more time for motorists travelling from Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre to cross the junction, leading to congestion and snarls.The GMDA official cited above said that the flyover will help commuters to avoid the traffic signal at the Bakhtawar Chowk. “At present, commuters have to stop at Subhash Chowk and then again at Bakhtawar Chowk, but with the flyover, commuters will be able to avoid one signal and go straight. The flyover will be double lane and so, movement will be easy both up and down,” the official said. The cost of construction has been estimated at over ₹60 crore and construction will start soon after approval. Officials said that the flyover should be functional by April 2022. Along with the flyover, work will also be undertaken to develop service lanes under the flyover and making left turns free at the intersection. For easing traffic congestion, the GMDA has already installed a smart traffic signal at Bakhtawar Chowk along with six other places in the city. A smart traffic signal is an automated one that takes into account the volume of traffic on a realtime basis. Officials will also put forth a proposal for extending GMDA’s coverage to the entirety of the Gurugram district in the meeting. In March, the authority initiated a proposal to extend the jurisdictional boundaries of GMDA as well as extend the Gurugram Metropolitan Area (GMA) to help with connectivity and management issues. The authority officials said they received five “positive” responses in this regard. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Admin issues protocols to RWAs and malls, asks residents to work from home  The district administration on Tuesday issued standard operating procedures to residents’ welfare associations and managements of malls and shopping complexes because of the increasing Covid-19 infections in the city. The administration officials appealed to the public to avoid travelling and work from home, if possible, and recommended RWAs to maintain a record of residents travelling by air and share the details with the authorities concerned for better tracking of cases.Ritesh Ranjan, divisional commissioner, Gurugram, who chaired a meeting of senior officials on the matter on Tuesday, directed the police and the district administration to enforce social distancing and mask discipline strictly.The district administration recommended that residents, who have travelled abroad, should inform the same to the RWAs, self-quarantine for two weeks and in case of symptoms, get themselves tested. The RWAs were also directed to share information about such residents with the health department.In the last three weeks, the city has witnessed rapid spread of the Covid-19 infection. The district reported 3,355 active cases on Tuesday evening, a sharp spike from around 600 active cases on March 15. There has been sharp rise in positivity rate as well, from 2.5% to 7.8% in this period. Taking cognizance of the fact that Gurugram has a large number of high-rise buildings, Ranjan said that directions must be issued to private condominiums and offices disallowing more than two persons to travel in an elevator at a go. He also directed the district administration to keep a tab on social functions and gatherings, as the wedding season will start soon and it has to be ensured that Covid-appropriate behaviours are adhered to. “The threat posed by Covid-19 is still very serious and as such, everyone must follow the safeguards and avoid undue travel. Everyone needs to keep strict vigil as this is a critical time,” Ranjan said in the meeting. Pradip Rahi, the president of Ramprastha City RWA said that they will follow the directions issued by the district administration, but it would be tough to get travel details from individual residents due to fear of harassment. “We have already asked the security detail and estate management to track the movement of visitors. Checking (temperatures) with infrared thermometers has already started. We will also request residents to share travel details as it will help stop the spread of Covid-19,” he said. Another resident, who wished anonymity, said that they will not share details with the RWA as this would compromise their privacy. “The RWAs should be kept under check or else, they start dictating terms and this makes life miserable for many,” the resident said. The deputy commissioner for Gurugram, Yash Garg, said that the administration’s permission must be taken, besides a no-objection certificate from the police and other departments, for all social functions related to education, entertainment, politics, sports and culture, among others.Due to the rising Covid-19 infections, the Gurugram administration capped the limit for indoor functions at 200, not exceeding half the capacity, while extending the cap to 500 for outdoor spaces. Garg said, “The committees formed at subdivision, tehsil and block levels will conduct inspections in their areas and enforce the safeguards prescribed for curbing the spread of Covid-19,” said Garg, adding that strict action would be taken against violators who don’t follow the safety protocols, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and similar safety rules.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Over 30-year-old Noida Golf Course boundary wall gets a makeover  Commuters along the busy Golf Course Road in Noida will soon be greeted by a colourful canvas on the sides of the main road. Mural paintings now adorn the 30-year-old boundary wall of Noida Golf Course (NGC) on Sector 43 that previously used to be in a dilapidated condition. From a golfer swinging a shot to that of another golfer putting, the art along the 450-metre long wall captures the essence of the Noida Golf Course. The work started in the first week of February and will end this week. The project was commissioned by the Noida Authority and funded by HCL as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) requirement. A Noida-based social enterprise called Ecoswop Solutions was roped in to carry out the designing and painting work. “The wall has an area of over 10,000 sq feet which has taken over two months to complete. We have kept the art work very colourful and the design is such that every golfer who sees it will view themselves in it in different stances. We hope the artwork will deter people from dirtying the wall as we have worked hard to beautify it,” says Tarunima Bajpai from Ecoswop Solutions. Golfers not just from Noida but across NCR come to the Noida Golf Course for golfing and are a happy lot after the makeover. “The boundary wall of the NGC was in a sad state of affairs for the past few years. However, the vibrant makeover of the wall is a refreshing change as it represents Noida on the golfing circuit in NCR,” says Kiran Chaudhary, a member of NGC, Ladies Club. Moreover, in December, another wall on the other side of the main road was also given a makeover. The artwork here has been done on the theme of corona warriors and it depicts not just doctors and health workers but also policemen and sanitation workers. “Apart from the wall art, a mural of golf sticks have also been put up at the roundabout infront of the Gold Course in order to project the area as a golf lovers’ hub,” Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari said.

              " ' Sahibabad villages oppose new traffic plan for Kaushambi  Four villages in Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area said they would oppose the Ghaziabad administration’s attempts to divert Delhi-Kaushambi traffic through their area. Residents there say that the plan would further pollute the villages.The plan was drawn up in response to a Supreme Court (SC) directive last month on the plea of Kaushambi residents. The court had then ordered the formation of a nine-member committee whose nodal officer would be the Ghaziabad district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey. The committee had members from the district administration, district police and Delhi officials.It proposed that the traffic, including UP Roadways buses, be diverted through Saur Urja Marg.The four-laned Saur Urja Marg is about 7-8kms stretch and connects near Kaushambi ISBT to Vasundhara intersection and passes through Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area, which the central pollution control board had identified as an air pollution hot spot.But residents of four villages, Kadkad Model, Maharjpur, Sahibabad and Jhandapur, feel that the plan would affect them badly.Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist and resident of Kadkad Model, said, “The industrial area is already polluted, and diversion of buses and vehicles will further intensify the problem. It is just an attempt to give relief to Kaushambi at our expense. We have sent representation to UP chief secretary and other officers and we will move Supreme Court if traffic is diverted through our area.”“The industrial area already has vehicles which remain parked on roads and if the plan is cleared, more vehicles will be diverted here and compound the issue. This will also increase risk of accidents for cyclists, children and daily commuters,” said Haji Arif, resident of Maharajpur one of the four villages . The four villages together have a population of around 300,000 to 400,000.“The latest plan including suggestions from UP and Delhi is only a draft and not a final plan,” said district magistrate Pandey. “Saur Urja Marg is proposed for diversion of buses. However, if residents have any issues, we will give them time and invite public objection for resolution of their issues.”In the plan, the authorities have also proposed enforcement against illegal buses and autos, removal of encroachment, regulation of permits of autos and e-rickshaws besides diversions and other traffic infrastructure measures in order to decongest and abate polluted surroundings at Kaushambi. They have also proposed parking spaces and a multi-level parking at Kaushambi metro station. The Supreme Court’s March 24 order was in response to Kaushambi residents welfare association (Karwa) that said the pollution in their area, which is close to two inter state bus terminals, had to be controlled. VK Mittal, president of Karwa, said that he could not comment over the issue of Saur Urja Marg. “If the residents of four villages have plan, they can move court with their issue. It is up to the court to decide their issue. Regarding the latest plan, we have issues and will submit our comments before the court,” he said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Noida authority to revise interest rate on land dues as per SC order  NOIDA: Responding to Noida Authority’s request for directions on matter of interest to be levied on real estate developers’ land dues, the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday asked it to resolve the issue as per rules.The direction clears the way for the authority to calculate the net amount due to it based on a previous Supreme Court (SC) order and move to begin registration of flats to thousands of homebuyers.In July last year the SC directed the authority to charge only 8.5% interest rate. Earlier, it would charge up to 25% in some cases. The Noida authority estimated that it had to receive ₹25,000 crore in land dues, as per its earlier interest rate. The officials are yet to calculate a figure based on the revised rates.The UP government also allowed developers to pay land dues on a per flat basis. It means if developers want to execute flat registry of 10 flats to homebuyers then they should accept financial dues in proportion to the 10 flats and allow registry. Earlier, the authority had wanted the developer to clear all dues and then execute registry.“But the developers will have to submit an affidavit stating that they will have to immediately resolve financial dues issue for once as per final order of SC,” said Rajesh Kumar officer on special duty of the Noida authority.The developers had long been demanding that the authority calculate the financial dues based on the Supreme Court order. They had said that they were ready to submit an affidavit stating they will pay remaining if needed as per a fresh order if it comes in future in this case. The lack of clarity over the interest rates meant that homebuyers could not get their flats registered. “Now we may take the proposal (of new rates and affidavit) submitted by the developers on board for a decision. And we will follow the directions taken in the board in future,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority. Builders welcomed the order.“Following the SC order, it will benefit around 20,000 flat buyers, and developers,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president of national real estate Developers Corporation.On July 10, 2020 the Supreme Court, while hearing petitions in a matter regarding the Amrapali Group, directed Noida Authority to only charge an interest rate of 8.5%, as per the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on land cost, fixed by the Reserve Bank of India, on land dues of developers. The order came in response to Noida-based developer ACE Group, through a plea, demanded that the “unreasonable” interest rate on group housing land should be looked into. ACE Group’s plea was clubbed with the Amrapali case. However the authority is yet to settle the financial issues of the developers in the light of the SC order because it has challenged the SC order in the Apex court. The SC will hear the authority plea challenging decision on interest on April 12. The developers had requested that the authority should calculate financial dues as per SC order with 8.5% until further decision is taken by the SC.

It also said that smoking with pipes and vapes may lead to transmission of Covid-19 via hand to mouth along with increasing the chances of higher risk of viral pneumonia.Several researchers since the onset of the pandemic have highlighted that smoking increases the chances of Covid-19 in people. The World Health Organization (WHO) in a report in July 2020 pointed out that smoking is connected to a higher risk of severe illness and death from the coronavirus among hospitalised patients. The study released last year highlighted that smokers represented up to 18% of hospitalised coronavirus patients. The WHO recommended smokers at the beginning of the pandemic to quit smoking.The Union health ministry also last year in a report pointed out that smokers were more likely to be vulnerable to Covid-19 as smoking increases the chances of transmission of virus from hand to mouth.A study by King’s College London conducted in January highlighted that smokers were 14% more likely to develop the symptoms suggesting diagnosis of Covid-19: fever, persistent cough and shortness of breath when compared to non-smokers. The study also found that along with these symptoms smokers were also likely to report symptoms like loss of smell, skipping meals, diarrhoea, fatigue, confusion or muscle pain which could lead to a severe case of Covid-19.

              " ' Exam Regulatory Authority seeks to defer teachers’ recruitment exam  PRAYAGRAJ Officials of the Examination Regulatory Authority, UP, headquartered in Prayagraj have written to the state government, seeking permission to postpone the proposed written examination for recruitments on 390 vacant posts of principal and 1,504 vacant posts of assistant teachers in 3,049 government-aided junior high schools across the state. Secretary, Examination Regulatory Authority, Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi sent a missive in this regard to postpone this examination scheduled on April 18 and conduct it after the panchayat elections. Polling is set to be held in 16 districts of UP on April 19 in the second phase of the panchayat polls, for which polling parties will leave by April 18. These 16 districts, which will see voting on April 19, include Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bijnor, Amroha, Badaun, Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Etawah, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot, Pratapgarh, Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur, Gonda, Maharajganj, Varanasi and Azamgarh. The move to postpone the recruitment exams follows district magistrates of various districts writing to the secretary of Examination Regulatory Authority pointing out that the entire administrative machinery would be busy during the elections. Due to this, it would not be possible for them to conduct the examination on April 18. “We have received letters from DMs of different districts, which would hold panchayat polls on April 19, because of which we have submitted the proposal to the state government with the request that the proposed exam of April 18 be postponed,” confirmed Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi, secretary, Examination Regulatory Authority, UP. Hindustan Times had highlighted this issue in its report – ‘Teachers in a fix over panchayat poll duty and recruitment exam’, published on March 4. This development is a relief for thousands of teachers and other government employees of government-run primary and upper primary schools, who had applied to appear in this recruitment drive and had been demanding postponement of the exam. They feared that they would be deprived of the opportunity to appear in this recruitment examination due to panchayat poll duty. Significantly, more than 3.25 lakh candidates had applied for this recruitment. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Expanded defence cooperation, free trade area figure in India, Russia talks  India and Russia on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen military and strategic cooperation, including manufacturing of Russian military hardware in the country, and begin talks on creating a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union. These matters figured in the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. “We talked about the longstanding partnership in nuclear, space and defence sectors... We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks.Lavrov, whose visit to New Delhi focussed on preparations for the annual India-Russia Summit to be held in the country later this year, said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “made in India” and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.“In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said.“Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20. Though it continues to account for almost 60% of the hardware of the Indian military, Russia is also facing growing competition from the US and France.Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said this was an issue for any country that wants to sign agreements with Russia for weapons systems. “We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation... We also discussed the prospect of additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment in India within the concept of ‘Made in India’,” Lavrov said, adding that there were no “fluctuations or changes” on the part of India.The US has held out the possibility of slapping sanctions on India over the purchase of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.Lavrov further said that working with India on trade and economic issues is one of the priorities of the Eurasian Economic Union, a bloc that includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. “We hope to launch talks on a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union based on mutual benefit,” he said.The two sides also agreed on the need to “galvanise work on the renewed inter-governmental agreement on mutual security of investments” and on increasing the share of national currencies in trade, he said.Jaishankar also briefed Lavrov on new economic initiatives, such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and the production-linked incentives programmes, to expand manufacturing in 13 sectors which have opened up new opportunities for Russian businesses. Lavrov said the two sides also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s the Far East and the Arctic, he said.Collaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. “For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Made in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Vladimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. “Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing. Russia itself has been concerned about increasing Chinese influence in these areas,” he said. “The Russian military hardware is certainly something we should consider, but after the S-400 and the threat of sanctions under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), nothing is going to be smooth sailing. Being the devil’s advocate, I’m not dismissing this but it isn’t as straightforward as it would appear,” Prakash said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

This was done o the instructions of Bombay high court, which passed an order in this regard on Monday.Deshmukh resigned on Monday after the order of the high court. In the resignation letter he sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Deshmukh said that he doesn't feel morally right to continue in the post.He was replaced by fellow Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dinesh Walse Patil who said that the state government will move Supreme Court against the high court order. Deshmukh too is filing a petition separately in the Supreme Court.The Maharashtra government questioned the procedure adopted by the high court saying that the state was heard on the question of maintainability of the pleas seeking CBI investigation against Deshmukh on the allegation of corruption, and the order too was reserved on that issue, but the court finally ended up directing the probe.Also Read| Deshmukh’s exit: The start of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance’s troubles?In his appeal, Deshmukh said that the high court order raises issues of seminal importance which “impact not just the federal structure of the country, impact on our polity, but also the manner in which, and the institutions through which investigations are to be conducted”.He said that the court must have been aware of the fact that the Maharashtra government had withdrawn its consent for the CBI to investigate matters in the territory of the state.The high court order came on a petition filed by Param Bir Singh, who was shunted out as Mumbai Police commissioner during the probe into a security threat case involving billionaire Mukesh Ambani.

As a result, the crowd is shifted to the other two booths in the hospital,” lamented Mahendra Pratap, a resident of Narhi, waiting for his number at the booth on Tuesday.In the last one week, a number of VVIPs have taken their vaccine at the Civil Hospital booth.He said, “Two vaccination counters at Civil Hospital present a different view. The one for the common man is overcrowded while the other one for the VIPs has all Covid protocols in place including social distancing and cleanliness. The counter for the common man has a small waiting area and bigger crowd while the VVIP booth is bigger with less crowd.”“The waiting area here is small as compared to the VVIP booth,” said NN Pandey, a senior citizen. However, Dr SK Nanda, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, said: “One must think before accusing the hospital of partisan approach, We have limited staff vaccinating around 600 to 850 people every day and have three vaccination booths. From today, we have started issuing tokens for vaccination and everyone is called accordingly. Even VVIPs are made to wait in a separate room for their turn.”He said, “In case of any complaint, people can approach us. Everyone knows we are serving at three booths with limited staff who have not taken leave for the last few months. One of them tested positive a few days back after a Covid patient came for vaccination. One of our doctors also tested positive last week.

              " ' Second wave of bird flu kills hundred birds in Himachal Pradesh  Around 100 migratory birds have been found dead in Pong Dam Lake in the last two weeks after the outbreak of a second wave of bird flu in Himachal Pradesh, wildlife officials said on Tuesday.Bird flu had first been confirmed among migratory water-birds at Pong Dam Lake Wildlife Sanctuary in early January that left around 5,000 birds dead in a month. It was contained in early February but has now resurfaced since late March beginning with the discovery of a dozen bird carcasses in the sanctuary on March 25, they added.Chief Wildlife Warden Archana Sharma said the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal has confirmed the presence of H5N8 avian influenza among the samples of the dead birds.This strain is different from the previous outbreak, when H5N1 had been detected among the migratory birds, she said adding that both these strains are highly pathogenic.Highly pathogenic subtypes of the avian influenza virus are known as highly contagious among birds and especially deadly for the poultry.Earlier this year, when bird flu outbreaks were reported across India, most of the states including neighbouring Haryana reported the H5N8 subtype of the virus, a strain which has not been known to infect humans.As of Tuesday, 99 birds have been found dead at Pong Dam lake during this resurgence, she added.Like the previous outbreak, most of the victims are bar-headed geese, she said adding that the dead birds also include nine greylag geese.The outbreak has so far been confined to two adjoining forest beats and bird fatalities are higher during days of adverse weather because that is when the geese tend to flock together instead of flying out, leading to more transmission of the virus, she added.An international Ramsar site with an area that extends up to 220 square kilometres during the wet season, the Pong wetland becomes home to flocks of migratory waterfowl each winter when wetlands in Europe, north and central Asia become frozen. A bird census in the sanctuary in February revealed the presence of over one lakh migratory water birds of 51 different species at the lake, including over 40 thousand bar-headed geese.With the onset of summer, the migratory birds are now flying back to their parent wetlands, she added.Many of the birds currently present in the lake are those which have flown from Rajasthan and other parts of the country, stopping here on their northward journey, she added.Some incidents of deaths of other birds have also been reported from other parts of the state, including Theog in Shimla district and Manali in Kullu district, and their samples have been taken for testing by the animal husbandry department.Meanwhile the sanctuary has again been closed for visitors, and the bird flu action plan has been activated, which includes surveillance, testing and scientific disposal of dead birds, she added.

There was a buzz around the polling booth at upscale Tiruvanmiyur when popular hero Ajith, sporting a mask, arrived with his wife Shalini. A crowd converged, especially young fans who vied with each other to have a close glimpse of the actor and click selfies. As a fan tried repeatedly to click selfies on his mobile, Kumar quietly snatched his phone and gestured him and others to disperse. Later, the actor returned the phone to his fan. Policemen, who faced a tough time managing the excited crowd,eventually closed the gate of the polling station and helped the star couple to vote quickly. When Ajith emerged from the booth, the crowd had by then swelled outside, shouted and greeted him by calling him \\'Thala\\' (head) and it turned out to be a herculean task for him and his wife to board their car. Top star Vijay sprang a surprise on his waiting fans by quietly emerging from his Neelankarai house riding a sleek bicycle while they followed him closely on motorcycles and scooters to the polling station which was close-by. However, the actor picking a bicycle to go to the booth to vote led to speculation in social media. Several netizens said it was a \\'subtle\\' sign of opposition to rise in fuel prices while his publicist said it was only due to parking problems in the vicinity and nothing else. Vijay-starrer movies over the past few years were particularly known for cocking a snook at the government. Vijay too faced a big turnout of fans who tried to get close, touch and click pictures with him. At one stage, police had to chase them away by using \"mild force\". While returning home, much to the joy of fans, Vijay chose to ride pillion on a supporter\\'s scooter. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics tamil nadu assembly elections ',\n",

              " ' ‘World’s two biggest democracies should join hands on confronting climate change’: John Kerry  US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, called on India to join hands with the US to confront the climate crisis through a clean energy transition.“Our two nations, the world’s two biggest democracies have a great deal to gain by joining hands and global leadership to confront climate change now. We must do this,” Kerry said in his address to the South Asia Women in Energy (SAWIE) Leadership Summit.Earlier in the day, Kerry met Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of President Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate to be held on April 22-23.“Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with Mr John Kerry. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. We discussed a range of issues including climate finance, joint research and collaboration etc,” Javadekar tweeted after the meeting.During his stay till Thursday, Kerry is likely to meet PM Modi, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, minister for external affairs S Jaishankar.In his address to the SAWIE summit, Kerry summed up his expectations from India. He also acknowledged the US’ role in historical emissions leading to the climate crisis.“Decisive action by India will determine what this sustainable transformation will mean for generations to come. India has the opportunity to both elevate women’s empowerment and to avoid the mistakes made by other countries like ours. Instead of building a modern and sustainable society that can be the envy of the world, some of us have contributed too much to the problem that we are living through today. We are working to build back better today in the US, to transform our economy in a way that prevents the impending climate crisis by keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees C and also create cutting edge jobs of the future,” he said.Also read: ‘Red hot investment’ - US Envoy John Kerry lauds India’s energy policyBut Kerry also underlined the need for a quicker clean energy transition and phasing out of coal. “India has an advantage that we didn’t have in the US. Not just the benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement but you also have the US as your friend and partner. We are here to support you on this path. India’s global leadership has been critical on a range of issues including delivering covid vaccines to the world. But I am particularly grateful that India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve, you are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership on the International Solar Alliance promises to advance clean energy across India and other dynamic growing economies,” he said.While lauding PM Modi’s announcement of achieving the target of 450 GW renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said it’s cheapest to build solar in India and that he wants to see India as the cleantech hub of Asia. “The International Energy Agency (IEA) special report said you (India) are on pace to become the global market leader on solar and storage by 2040. It’s already cheaper to build solar in India than anywhere else in the world. That kind of urgency is exactly what we need to confront global climate change. We are in the decisive decade for action,” Kerry stated.Kerry said a zero-emissions future holds huge business opportunity. Global investment in new clean power capacity is said to exceed 10 trillion dollars through mid-century, more than 6 times the investment in dirtier options. “Still a net-zero energy transition will require innovation and scaling up. It’s critical that the US, India and other partners build the enhanced clean industries of the future - decarbonised industries… In 2021 we have a rare opportunity to create new technologies and new markets and India is seizing this opportunity,” Kerry said, adding that India could add half a million additional jobs by 2030 if it pursues clean energy transition aggressively.Underling the urgency of the climate crisis, Kerry said to get where we need to go according to the Paris Agreement and as per the scientists to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees C, we need to phase out coal five times faster than we have been, we need to increase tree cover five times faster, ramp up renewable energy six times faster.According to senior environment ministry officials, one of the key objectives of Kerry’s visit is to get India to join the countries that have announced a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In September 2020, China announced that it will peak its GHG emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The White House announced on January 27 that President Joe Biden will take steps to put the United States (US) on an “irreversible path” to a net-zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations on April 22 to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.“A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country, especially for a lower-middle-income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need several technologies to become better and cheaper - energy storage, faster EV charging, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysers, agricultural technologies, carbon capture, and direct air capture - which will be absolutely crucial to achieving any net-zero target. Public and private partnerships with the US can play a very important role in technological innovation and adaptation to India’s needs. The quest for a net-zero emissions future could bring new jobs and better health for Indians. But much depends on the infusion of international capital and disruptive technologies,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Others were hoisted directly from the deck.All were brought to safety, but the ship has continued to drift towards land. It is currently some 74 km (40 miles) off the Norwegian coast.The wind is expected to gradually shift the vessel to a course parallel to the shore, giving the salvage operation more time, Hans Petter Mortensholm of the Norwegian Coastal Administration told Reuters.\"Our calculations now indicate a window of opportunity to act, lasting until just after midday on Wednesday,\" he said. \"The risk of pollution is our main concern.\"The Hendrika has around 350 tonnes of heavy oil and 50 tonnes of diesel in its tanks, the Coastal Administration said.Smit Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch marine services company Boskalis, told Reuters it had been contracted to try saving the ship and was mobilising a team to send to Norway later on Tuesday.Safety permitting, Smit would seek to get its own crew on board the Hendrika and link the vessel to a so-called anchor handling tug, a powerful ship built to move rigs for the oil industry.\"Getting her onto a tow line and to a calmer location, that is the goal,\" Smit Salvage spokesman Martijn Schuttevaer said.A Norwegian coastguard vessel is on standby in the area and could also be used for towing purposes, the Coastal Administration said.Built in 2015 and registered in the Netherlands, the 111.6 metre (366 feet) Eemslift Hendrika is a yacht transport vessel, carrying smaller boats on its deck, according to Monaco-based Starclass Yacht Transport, which markets the ship\\'s services.One of the smaller vessels strapped to the deck fell off in the storm, the Coastal Administration said.

              " ' In latest ordinance, Congress sees ‘terrible breach of trust’  An ordinance to end part of India’s appellate structure has irked Congress with party leaders dashing out letters to protest “a terrible breach of trust”. They also wondered if “anything better” be expected from the NDA government. At the heart of the conflict is The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance that was promulgated on Sunday. Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh claimed that NDA’s parliament managers had assured the Opposition during the budget session that the bill would be sent to a standing committee for review. In a letter to the Rajya Sabha chairman, Ramesh said, “I am not writing to you on the merits of the ordinance. All I wish to do is express my disgust at the terrible breach of faith as far as not referring the bill to the standing committee concerned.”The legislation, piloted by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, aims to dissolve at least eight existing appellate tribunals and transfer their responsibilities to other bodies including high courts. Jairam claimed that when the budget session was drawing to a close, government managers informed him that the bill would not be taken up for passage and would be sent to a House panel. Congress leader Manish Tewari shot a similar letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and argued that chapter 12 of the bill introduces major amendments to section 184 of the finance bill and directly impacts the functioning and composition of 19 key tribunals. He added that the proposed law envisages a “complete control” over the mechanisms of 19 tribunals and said, “the bill must be referred to the standing committee for a thorough review of any inherent vulnerabilities in the proposed amendments. Given the sheer degree of dilution or modification that can be done through the misuse of this power, you will surely agree that the amendments should not be hurried and must be examined.”The NDA’s ordinance route and passing bills without review of parliamentary panels have been a matter of concern for the Opposition. PRS Legislative Research said in its report, “In the 17th Lok Sabha, so far, 11% of the introduced Bills have been referred to a committee; much lower than the 14th (60%), 15th (71%), and 16th (27%) Lok Sabhas.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " \" 'Change in thought process, social norms key for gender diversity at workplace'  The covid-19 pandemic has impacted the recruitment scenario in many organisations in the country and around the world. Companies are also facing challenges in ensuring the safety and security of its employees. The Human Resource department of any organisation plays a very important role in recruitment of staff, taking care of their well-being and implementing good HR practices at the workplace. In an email interview with Hindustan Times online, Seema Trikannad, Chief of Human Resources and Management Services, SBI Life Insurance, talks about the various challenges faced by them during the Pandemic and how they are trying to overcome them. She also discusses the importance of gender diversity at workplace and important traits which organizations should look for while hiring a person.How has the pandemic impacted the recruitment scenario in the insurance sector, especially at SBI Life?While the initial impact was significant, over the past year, the sector has recouped. The confidence is returning as the market is adjusting to a new working format and becoming increasingly active.In this recovery, technology has been a major driving force, both within the insurance industry as well as in recruitment. Embracing work from home and investing significant time and energy in building a secure technological environment were the most important steps taken by all organisations for the safety and well-being of its employees and protection of data in the WFH context. Similarly, even in recruitment, we have relied heavily on technology.The digital interventions start right from the hiring stage with the on boarding process which helps in operational ease and efficiency. Also, the induction process is a blend of both classroom and e induction model. This helps in guiding the new employees with regard to the Company’s policies and processes at a pace that they are comfortable with. We also have an HR ChatBot which is an AI powered HR chat assistant to address employee queries at the click of a button. Last year, we on boarded more than 3500 candidates ranging from entry to senior levels.Technology is also helping in ensuring uniformity in employee experience and engagement. This year, we conducted the first ever virtual employee engagement event- our annual in house talent show- in which employees from across the country participated and which was witnessed by employees from even the remotest location. The online games, talent hunt and performances by our employees on the virtual platform helped us in keeping their spirits high even in such times.How do you ensure safety and security of employees during the pandemic?As an organisation, our core philosophy is that the safety and well-being of our employees is our priority at all times, as we do for our partners, distributors, customers etc. Providing a secure work environment, one that demonstrates emergency readiness and a strong security framework, is paramount. With increased covid cases and rising uncertainty, last year, SBI Life launched an emotive ‘WE CAN, WE WILL’ anthem, to lift the spirits at a time when the nation’s morale was at its lowest. This one of a kind initiative saw 27 local celebrities from different parts of the country singing the WE CAN, WE WILL anthem in nine different languages that was broadcast on over 30 television channels nationally. Additionally, we have constantly striven towards bettering the work environment for our employees through a number of initiatives:Steps taken by the company:Embraced work from home: To contain the spread of the infection, we embraced wfh and empowered all our employees with necessary digital tools to stay connected with our customers and to address any of their immediate insurance needsSpecial leave on account of COVID: We introduced a special leave policy over and above the annual leave entitlement, to support our employees in this hour of need if they or their family member was infected.Isolation facilities: At the time when cases were on the rise, doctors advised the asymptomatic patients to isolate themselves in their homes, rather than the centres and take prescribed treatment. As an immediate step, we approached renowned hospitals for providing isolation rooms to Covid positive asymptomatic patients (employees) and their immediate family members so as to contain further spread of infectionConsistent communication: Our leadership actively engaged with the employees ensuring constant communication and immediate solutions to any pain points brought forward by the employees.Counselling and mental health support: Mental health has also been affected to some extent just like physical health during this period. With the help of our NGO partner, we facilitated a platform where our employees could anonymously seek the required help, guidance and counselling, when felt stressed and anxious due to the ongoing situation.While we are constantly striving to better the environment in which our employees work, we will leave no stone unturned to keep them safe and protected.What is the importance of gender diversity at the workplace, especially in the insurance sector? How do you achieve this at SBI Life?Gender inequality is a major area of concern the world over and India’s diversity only exacerbates that issue. Historically, women have been denied many opportunities because of deep-rooted biases in the social system. Over the past few decades, women’s participation in regular or high-skilled jobs has improved. Increasing economic participation of women will require priority, resource allocation, and a change in thought processes and social norms. At the organizational level, a sense of fair play should be integral to its culture. The senior management should constantly reiterate amongst the workforce the need for both genders to work synergistically and reward efforts towards the same.Over the past three years, our employee strength has gone up from around 13,200 to 17,500 and during this period, we took consistent efforts to improve our gender mix. We have actively been recruiting women staff. This year, we are taking it a step further to run a targeted hiring plan aimed at on boarding female employees. In fact, the number of female employees in the company has gone up by 35% over the last three years. We have been consistently working towards building a more equal and inclusive organisation. Our initiatives are aimed at increasing the number of female employees so as to build a more inclusive workforce within the organisation. We also try to ensure that women have a congenial work environment and consistently appreciate and applaud efforts aimed at achieving inclusivity.What in your opinion are the most important traits that an organization should look for while hiring a person?In the process of securing top notch employees for an organisation, attracting qualified applicants is just half the battle. Organizations should focus on selecting candidates who can think out-of-the-box and fit well in the company’s culture. Some of the traits that are crucial in a hiring process are:Communication skills: The importance of effective communicators in a company environment cannot be emphasized enough. Having good communication skills, both written and oral, is essential for any employee to sustain in a team environment.Team Work: Team work contributes in an organisation’s success and development. Therefore, it is very important to hire candidates who are team players. This becomes even more relevant in the current WFH scenario, where there is a constant need for cooperation with your team members. A person who is capable of working in a team setting will enhance the productivity of the organisation by bolstering the work of others. Agility: Everywhere today, industries are facing disruptions. The pandemic has taught to be agile and ever ready for any kind of upheaval caused by external factors. Thus, having candidates who are adaptive in nature and are receptive to change is essential for every organisation.Creativity: Creativity is the essence of every successful business. Being able to think out-of-the-box is a valued trait in today’s job market. Organisations should look for versatile team members who can apply their learnings towards finding creative solutions to a business problem. Candidates with a creative thought process will always prove to be beneficial for a company in setting industry benchmarks. Proactive and independent thinking: Apart from team skills, a candidate’s ability to work on their own with nil or minimal supervision is also an important trait. Many times, companies face situations which require their employees to work proactively. In such scenarios, only people with independent thinking can lead the charge and challenge the status quo.While I don’t downplay the importance of the traits listed above, as an HR professional, the first thing I would look for in a candidate is attitude and cultural fit. While other traits can be learned or cultivated, these two are part of a person’s nature.What in your opinion are some good HR practices? How is SBI life working to achieve and maintain them?HR plays a vital part in the success of a business and so is an important department in any organization or business. Good HR practices help in building strategic human resource management, increased employee’s engagement, improved retention in the teams and enhanced productivity.Some of the required HR practices that every organization, small or large, should have are:Playing fair: This is easier said than done. But it is absolutely important to create and nurture a feeling among employees that their employer is fair and does not display any overt or covert biases towards any group or individual. As a corollary, you also need to have an intuition of when to follow the book and when to provide some leeway.Keeping employee’s safety and well-being in the forefront: An organisation progresses when they consider the safety and well-being of their employees as an important factor in taking any important decision. Last March, when lockdown was a fairly new word, all measures that we took were dictated by two principles- the health and safety of our employees and the security and continuance of our operations. Work from home, flexible working hours, dedicated transport facility for employees were some of the measures we adopted. Due to the distancing norms, we ensured that our buses carried only 30-40% of the regular capacity.Diversity & Inclusion: Having a diverse workforce should be a priority for HR departments in every organisation. In the BFSI sector specifically, we have a skewed gender ratio, especially in the senior management. The efforts we put in now to improve the situation will show results 12-15 years later. Besides having the appropriate HR policies to ensure this, the senior management of the company should foster an inclusive culture and create a conducive atmosphere for gender diverse teams. Similarly, opportunities should be provided for people with special needs.Any advice you would like to give to new companies which are trying to establish themselves, and a new generation of employees?People management is a challenging task if you’re a relatively new company. You have to constantly work towards finding the best talent and fit for your company. In their initial years, new companies do not have much traction. Hence, the hiring process is very challenging. Such organisations need to leverage hybrid working models such as on-boarding freelancers. Often freelancers are keen on joining a growing organisation because of an elevated learning curve. Through this, you will save on your costs to a great extent. Also, you will get a chance to judge their performance before your hire them for a full time role.People with risk taking abilities, who can think out of the box, are best suited to work in a new organisation because of the constant need to take crucial decisions. Thus, it’s important to look for self-starters who can work unsupervised and take charge if need be.

However, Ranchi University postponed its offline semester examinations for undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students in light of spike in Covid-19 cases, officials said on Tuesday.One of the university colleges Marwari College was scheduled to conduct UG and PG semester examinations from April 7. However, it cancelled offline examinations and will conduct them in online mode. Its principal UC Mehta said, “In view of rising cases of Covid-19, we have postponed offline semester examinations for UG and PG students. The examinations were scheduled from April 7. Now, the examination will be conducted online. The fresh examination date will be declared in a day or two.”Public relation officer (PRO) of Ranchi University PK Jha said, “In a meeting of the university’s Covid-19 cell on Tuesday, it was decided to resume online classes till further notice.”Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee University, Ranchi, has postponed offline classes till April 17.JAC officials, however, said they started practical examinations for students of classes 10 and 12 with precautions. “In light of Covid-19, practical examinations will be conducted over a period of 22 days in different sittings depending upon infrastructure of schools. Only 15 students will be allowed to enter the centre in one sitting. A school can conduct maximum three sittings in a day,” said JAC secretary Mahip Kumar Singh.The written examinations for classes 10 and 12 will take place from May 4 to 21. More than 4.31 students were expected to take the matric examinations, while over 3.32 students will take intermediate examinations.

              " ' Mastermind of Easter terror attacks identified: Sri Lankan minister  A top Sri Lankan minister said on Tuesday that a radical cleric, who is now under detention, has been identified as the mastermind of the deadly Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 that killed 270 people, including 11 Indians.Nine suicide bombers, belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ) linked to ISIS, carried out coordinated blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on the Easter Sunday in 2019.\"Naufer Moulavi was the mastermind (of the Easter bombings),\" Minister of Public Security Sarath Weerasekera told reporters here.Weerasekera said that the cleric was assisted by another person identified as Hajjul Akbar.He said 32 suspects have been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder.Eight dossiers have been handed over to the Attorney General, he said, adding that another 75 suspects are under detention.The total number of suspects in the remand custody is 211, including the 32, who have been charged, he added.The Buddhist-majority nation was about to mark a decade since ending a 37-year-long Tamil separatist war in May 2009 when the suicide bombings in 2019 rocked the country.The attacks caused a political storm as the then government headed by President Maithirpala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was blamed for its inability to prevent the deadly attacks despite the prior intelligence made available on the impending terror strikes.During his tenure, Sirisena formed a presidential panel to probe the attacks.In its report, the panel said that former president Sirisena and a host of other top defence officials, including former defence secretaries, former IGPs and intelligence chiefs, were guilty of ignoring prior intelligence. The panel report recommended criminal action against them.Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the head of the local Catholic church, has been demanding action against Sirisena.The Colombo Church has been holding a \\'Black Sunday\\' congregation every week, demanding justice for the victims.Ranjith has vowed to take drastic action if the real culprits were not dealt with by the second anniversary of the attacks on April 21.The findings of the presidential panel which found Sirisena culpable has come under criticism by political parties claiming that the panel had not been able to identify the masterminds and those who provided funds to the bombers.The panel had recommended that findings against Sirisena and the then police top brass be referred to the Attorney General for necessary legal action.Sirisena has publicly denied receiving any prior information on the attacks.

              " ' Tejashwi campaigns for Trinamool in Bengal, fields party veterans too  Keeping his promise of campaigning for the Trinamool Congress in the West Bengal Assembly polls, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav not only addressed his first election meeting at Kidderpore recently, but also deployed at least 10 MLAs from Saran, Gopalganj and Siwan in the neighbouring state to canvass support for Mamata Banerjee’s party among voters having their origins in Bihar. “Though the programme is being held In Kolkata, I feel I am in Chapra,” Yadav started off his speech at Kidderpore on Sunday to canvass for Trinamool’s prominent face and urban development minister Firhad Hakim alias Bobby Hakim, who is in the fray from Kolkata port constituency. Kolkata has a good number of people hailing from Saran, which has been an RJD stronghold “I have asked my party MLAs from Chapra, Gopalganj and Siwan to canvass strongly in favour of the Trinamool. They will be here for sometime,” he said. A Bhojpuri singer, Pramod Premi Yadav , who has done several numbers eulogizing Tejashwi before the 2020 Bihar polls, also regaled the crowd at the election meeting. “ He was roped in by local organisers. He is a popular name among Bhojpuri singers and well known in various cities, including in Kolkata,” said Sanjay Yadav, a close aide of Tejashwi, who was present at the Kidderpore meeting. In the ongoing West Bengal polls, Bihar natives settled in Kolkata and other towns like Asansol, Durgapur and Raniganj are crucial for the ruling Trinamool as well as rival BJP, a reason why both parties have sought help of their leaders from Bihar and UP. Tejashwi was unsparing in his attack on the BJP at the election meeting, where he raised issues of price rise, unemployment and economic contraction. He also accused the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre of blocking all employment avenues in government sector by privatizing railways, telecom, coal and selling off PSUs. Striking an emotional note, Tejashwi said Mamata Banerjee and his jailed father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad shared a close bond.”Mamata didi has always stood with Laluji. She respects him a lot.”The leade of Opposition in Bihar, whose party has extended support to Trinamool in Bengal polls by not fielding any candidate, would be holding election rallies at various constituencies in Kolkata, like Chowrangee, Jorashanko and also in Asansol and Raniganj after April 15 ahead of the last few phases of Bengal polls, RJD sources said. The BJP, however, said it’s not worried. “Tejashwi is not such a political stalwart that he would able to check Trinamool’s slide and help it to return to power in Bengal polls,” said Arvind Singh, BJP’s state spokesperson. He also slammed the RJD leader for campaigning for Trinamool whose chief had made disparaging comments against people from Bihar and UP before the Nandigram polls by saying BJP had brought in goons from two states to intimidate voters. “TMC chief has never called Biharis or people from UP goons. She had said BJP goons had come from two states,” said Chittaranjan Gagan, RJD’s state spokesperson. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The lone MLA siding with the NDA candidate has come as a huge embarrassment to the LJP, which has been at the loggerheads with JD (U) since the Bihar Assembly polls in November 2020. The party had fielded 143 candidates during assembly elections, which caused damage to JD(U) on many seats. A month back, the lone LJP MLA had sparked speculation of joining JD(U) following his meeting with the chief minister and a state minister. Of late, LJP has witnessed heavy defections, with over 200 party leaders and office-bearers joining JD (U) last month. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Uttarakhand HC takes suo moto cognisance of alarming forest fires  Taking suo moto cognisance of the alarming forest fires in the state, Uttarakhand High Court on Tuesday summoned principal chief convertor of forests (PCCF) Rajiv Bhartari to explain the preparedness of the state forest department and measures that have been taken over the years. The PCCF has been directed to attend the meeting on Wednesday through video-conferencing. Dushyant Mainali, an advocate, said he had mentioned the raging forest in the state before the HC on Monday, following which the court took cognisance and heard the matter on Tuesday. “The court said it understands that measures are being taken now, but what about the preparedness and measures taken before the forest fires to check them. The PCCF will have to explain this to the court at 10 am during the hearing on Wednesday through video-conferencing”, he said. Mainali said he also submitted various documents and media reports, including one by HT, before the court. “The court also expressed its concern over the smoke that is emanating from the forest fires and affecting the locals, especially during Covid times when many patients face breathing problems,” he said. Also read: Uttarakhand forest minister posts video fighting forest fire with twigs, slammedMainali said he also raised the issue of the 2004 state government order that had talked about community participation on a major level through van panchayats for checking forest fires in the state. This is not the first time when the courts have expressed their concerns about forest fires in the state. Taking cognisance of the raging forest fires in the state in 2016, when over 4,400 hectares of forest land had been damaged, the HC had directed the state to appoint at least 10,000 fire watchers to keep a tab on forest fire incidents and check them.In May 2018, the HC while taking suo moto cognisance of the forest fires in the state, directed the state government to submit the details of the forest fires, the kind of damage and the steps taken by the government to prevent them. In its response, the state government informed the HC that 90% of the forest fires in the state were “manmade”. Surprised, the HC remarked, “We were very shocked to hear the reply of the government. How is it possible when people have migrated from thousands of villages, they have a role in 90% of the forest fires in the state”. In June 2019, a public interest litigation (PIL) on forest fires in Uttarakhand highlighted that forest fires were wiping out entire species of birds, small insects and animals. The PIL, filed in the Supreme Court by a Tehri Garhwal-based advocate, stated that carbon dioxide emitted from the fires was causing heat in the hills resulting in a faster meltdown of glaciers, besides causing pollution and ecological imbalance. The PIL sought urgent steps to protect/safeguard the forests, wildlife and birds from the forest fires in Uttarakhand and also efforts to ensure the right to a healthy environment. Since the beginning of this year, Uttarakhand has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents that have damaged around 1,540 hectares of forest land. Till Monday evening, there were over 85 forest fires raging in the state’s hill districts, that damaged over 165 acres of forest land in the previous 24 hours. Of the 1,130 forest fire incidents reported, the maximum (269) were reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 116 in Tehri, 100 in Bageshwar, 94 in Pithoragarh, 93 in Almora, data provided by the state forest department states. From 2000 to April 5 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires. Forest fire activity is generally reported from February to June, with a peak in fire incidence in May and June. Besides man-made, other reasons for forest fires in the state include lightning, friction from falling rocks, among others. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Speaking about shifting of Mukhtar from Punjab\\'s Rupnagar jail to UP\\'s Banda, Afzal said he has full faith in the judiciary.Mukhtar is being shifted after an order of the Supreme Court to be tried for various criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh.\"Their intention is not right. In the same Banda jail, he (Mukhtar) was given poison in tea... we have full faith in the judiciary. We have moved a plea to provide medical facilities to him,\" Afzal Ansari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.\"I am hopeful that Supreme Court will ensure that those in power don\\'t kill someone.

A minister says \\'gaadi to palat ke rahegi (the car will definitely overturn)\\',\" he added.The remarks were in reference to the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in July last year. Dubey was gunned down by the police in an encounter after he “attempted to flee” while being brought to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain where he was arrested.\"If they do something arbitrarily, then the time for end of such dictators is nearing. Sacrifice is needed to end dictatorship. If such a thing happens, I will consider that Mukhtar has been sacrificed for the end of the dictatorial government,\" said Afzal Ansari.The Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday took custody of Mukhtar Ansari, leaving with him from Punjab’s Rupnagar jail in a convoy headed 900 km away for a prison in Banda where security has been tightened to hold the gangster-turned-politician.The transfer happened after a bitter legal battle in the Supreme Court in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh accused the Congress government in Punjab of “shielding” Ansari for several months by not letting the state take custody.Ansari has been lodged in Rupnagar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.According to the UP police, Mukhtar Ansari faces 52 cases in the state - including murder, attempt to murder, cheating and conspiracy - and 15 of them are at the trial stage.Punjab\\'s home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take Ansari’s custody by April 8, following the March 26 Supreme Court order that had set a two-week deadline.Ansari will be kept in barrack number 15 of the Banda district jail when he reaches there on Wednesday morning, an official said.

              " ' Fetal heartbeat monitoring best method to reduce unnecessary C-section: Study  The findings of a new study led by researchers at the University of Warwick suggested that simple fetal heartbeat monitoring is still the best method for determining whether a baby is in distress during delivery and whether cesarean delivery is needed.The findings of the study were published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal). Cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure worldwide, performed to expedite birth and avoid neonatal complications.Listening to the fetal heart rate using a stethoscope -- intermittent auscultation -- has been used for years to assess the fetal state and whether the baby is experiencing distress that might require a cesarean delivery. Other monitoring techniques have become common in recent years, including echocardiograms and blood tests.\"Despite extensive investment in clinical research, the overall effectiveness of such methods in improving maternal and neonatal outcomes remains debatable as stillbirth rates have plateaued worldwide, while cesarean delivery rates continue to rise,\" wrote Dr Bassel Al Wattar, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom, with coauthors.Researchers from the United Kingdom and Spain reviewed 33 studies that included more than 118,000 women, mainly from high-income countries as well as India and Tanzania, to evaluate the effectiveness of different monitoring methods in improving outcomes for mothers and babies and reducing the number of cesarean deliveries.They found that all methods had similar outcomes for babies, but only intermittent auscultation reduced the risk of cesarean deliveries without increased risk to babies\\' health. The researchers estimate that intermittent auscultation led to an average 30 per cent reduction in emergency cesareans compared to other methods.\"Our analysis suggests that all additional methods introduced to improve the accuracy of electronic fetal heart monitoring have failed to reduce the risk of adverse neonatal or maternal outcomes beyond what intermittent auscultation achieved 50 years ago, and this may have contributed to the increased incidence of unnecessary emergency cesarean deliveries,\" wrote the authors.The authors urge investment in developing novel techniques to monitor fetuses to make delivery safer for mothers and their babies.

              " ' India could resume vaccine exports by June, says SII CEO Adar Poonawalla  The world\\'s largest vaccine maker, based in India, will be able to restart exports of AstraZeneca doses by June if new coronavirus infections subside in the country, its chief executive said Tuesday.But a continued surge could result in more delays because the Serum Institute of India would have to meet domestic needs, Adar Poonawalla warned in an interview with The Associated Press.The company is a key supplier for the UN-backed COVAX program that aims to distribute vaccines equitably in the world. On March 25, COVAX announced a major setback in its vaccine rollout because a surge in infections in India caused the Serum Institute of India to cater to domestic demand, resulting in a delay in global shipments of up to 90 million doses.Since then, daily new infections in India have almost doubled, with the biggest single-day spike of over 100,000 new cases on Monday. Infections are being reported faster in India than anywhere else in the world, prompting tougher virus restrictions in New Delhi and its financial capital, Mumbai.India initially immunized the most vulnerable, but broadened that to anyone over 45 on April 1 because of the surge in cases. The resulting increased demand forced the halt in exports. Since then, several top state officials have urged the federal government to further expand vaccinations.Poonawalla said the company has “chosen to prioritize India temporarily for two months” and hopes to then restart exports.If India\\'s surge in infections doesn\\'t subside, \"I am scared of what ... we will have to do, and what will happen,” he said. “We are going to have to keep supplying to India, and not anywhere else. Because we have to protect our nation.”He acknowledged that has put a “strain on our contractual obligations” to provide vaccines to other countries, and that he has been fielding phone calls from various heads of state.“I\\'ve had to politely explain to everybody the situation,” he said, adding that most world leaders understood because they were facing the same issues — the needs of domestic politics and questions raised by opposition parties and the public.“Nationalism is happening ... to a certain extent, everywhere,” Poonawalla said, pointing to vaccine export controls imposed by Europe, and the use in the United States of the Defense Production Act to prevent exports of critical raw materials needed to scale up vaccine manufacturing.He said the unavailability of these raw materials, such as the specific medium needed to grow microorganisms, could affect the Serum Institute\\'s production of another vaccine, Novavax, which is still being tested in India. It has signed a deal to supply Novavax to COVAX, but pivoting to different suppliers of the raw materials would result in a delay of five to six months, he said.“The crunch ... for supplies is today,\" he said.

              " ' Goa to belatedly implement new Motor Vehicle Act from May 1  The Goa government will belatedly begin implementing the new Motor Vehicles Act from May 1 this year, levying heavy fines on traffic rule transgressors, Goa’s transport minister Mauvin Godinho said. “We had delayed the implementation because the repairs of roads were not being taken up in due earnest by the government. The repairs of roads all over Goa is (now) being undertaken on a war footing,” transport minister Mauvin Godinho said. The Motor Vehicles Act , which became law back in 2019 after it was passed by Parliament, involves steeper fines running into thousands of rupees. It was not adopted by the state government after a backlash by the public over demand for ‘decent’ roads. “We are going to adopt the new Motor Vehicle Act which was long overdue. The new MV Act will be implemented from May 1 and we are going to use this intervening period to bring about an awareness about its implementation,” Godinho added. The state government has notified the new law which would now mean that road users will have to pay steeper fines ranging from ₹1,000 for failing to wear seat belts, to ₹10,000 for not allowing emergency vehicles to pass with an even higher fee for a second subsequent offence. “All ADTs (assistant directors of transport) are going to hold programmes in their respective jurisdictions to educate people on traffic rules. The simple narrative is going to be, ‘if you don’t break the rules, there is no question of paying fine’,” Godinho said. Goa’s vehicle density is among the highest in the country with the vehicle to population ratio nearly at 1:1 with more than 14-lakh vehicles on the roads for a population that is a little over 15-lakh.The Opposition has, however, alleged that the conditions of the roads are not satisfactory for the implementation of the Act.“Bankrupt @BJP4Goa Government which has failed to provide proper motorable roads now increases fines for traffic violations further pushing common man into financial disaster. Will @goacm take responsibility of casualties & fatal accidents due to bad infrastructure?” Leader of Opposition, Digambar Kamat tweeted. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The fire was brought under control in thirty minutes.” He further said “There are many buildings located in the area which include shops and small tenements which could have been damaged had we not got control of the blaze quickly. As a practice the gas pipelines are supposed to be underground but this one was almost at the surface and we have recommended an investigation in detail. The MNGL personnel arrived at the spot and we have briefed them about the incident. They have informed us that matter will be looked into. There was no casualty in the incident.” The beginning of summer is marked by a rise in fire incidents with January, February and March 2021 having witnessed 123, 180 and 244 incidents of fire in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits respectively.

The mini lockdown being implemented by the district administration in Pune is seeing harsher measures like road closures through barricading by Pune police to prevent citizens from travelling from one area to another. The road closure strategy for nakabandi will put severe restrictions on travel within the city and help in breaking the chain.

              " ' Autorickshaws hit despite PMPML shutdown  With no public buses plying on the road, many autorickshaw drivers are feeling the pinch of losing out on daily earnings. Despite the PMPML shutdown, scores of autorickshaws are standing vacant in the city awaiting passengers. “Enforcing the lockdown and shutting down PMPML buses have been a bad idea. We used to get many of our passengers who would alight from the buses and then prefer us to take them to the city’s peth areas. But with almost every shop closed, there are hardly any passengers,” said Ravindra Poredi who has been a licensed auto rickshaw driver for past 23 years in the city. Poredi along with other driver friends stand at the Shri Sadguru Jungli Maharaj rickshaw stand daily. “We have been waiting since morning and there have been no trips at all. We are here to help people get them to their destination, but no one seems to be out,” said Sanjay Saswade. Although there are none of the regular travellers, these rickshaw owners are not afraid of the Covid-19 virus and are in fact willing to help any passenger reach the nearest Covid testing centre. “I dropped a senior citizen to Ruby Hall clinic, she had trouble breathing, but I was glad to be of help,” said Rahim Habib Sheikh, who has been plying an auto rickshaw in city for 20 years. “We are not afraid of ferrying passengers or even Covid positive patients, we are well equipped with sanitizers, and a thick plastic screen,” said Sunil Kadam who comes daily from Wagholi to ply his rickshaw in the city. The rickshaws outside KEM hospital are now often used to ferry discharged patients home. “We are called out by the security guard of the hospital and then also informed by the hospital staff accompanying the patient that we should sanitize the rickshaw after we drop them to their destination,” said Laxman Suryavanshi, who has ferried several patients home. “The biggest worry that most autorickshaw drivers face is of not earning enough. When everything was normal, we would make around ₹400 to ₹500 but now, it is difficult to get a trip above ₹100. This way, we won’t be able to look after our family nor pay instalments for the rickshaws,” said Rakesh Pardeshi. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Tuchel seeks return of calm after Chelsea bust-up  Soon after his 14-match unbeaten start at Chelsea ended, Thomas Tuchel had a warning for his players.“We cannot lose our heads now,” the Chelsea manager said after Saturday\\'s 5-2 loss to a West Bromwich side facing relegation from the Premier League.What unfolded at the training ground on Sunday was just the reaction he didn\\'t want to see: A clash between defender Antonio Rudiger and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.There is no denying from Tuchel, who replaced the fired Frank Lampard in January, that the incident \"got heated.\" Ensuring there are no lingering tensions in the camp from the bust-up is key, with fourth place to secure in the Premier League and the more immediately pressing matter of the first leg against Porto in the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Wednesday.“We calmed the situation down immediately,” Tuchel said Tuesday. \"I don’t want to play it down with anything artificial. These are things we don’t want to accept. It was unusual but they can happen.“They are all competitors and want to win training matches. We needed to interfere in the situation, so that was serious. But the way the guys handled the situation, that was impressive and showed a lot of courage.\"Tuchel maintains the air has been cleared between players who were left on the bench for Saturday\\'s setback at Stamford Bridge.“They sorted it out straight after training in a very honest, humble and very direct way,” Tuchel said. \"That showed me they have very good character.“Toni sorted it out directly, and it was a strong and brave thing to do. So I am happy with the way they dealt with it.”Losing to West Brom could prove costly with Chelsea surrendering the fourth Champions League place with eight games remaining to a West Ham side that has never qualified for the competition.“We’ve been analyzing the game, trying to correct mistakes and to be ready for the next one,\" Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso told beIN Sports. “It’s always good to watch the games, improve, and take responsibility. From there, do better the next game and don’t make the same mistakes. That’s how you grow as a player and as a team”. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics thomas tuchel ',\n",

As Covid cases have been spiking in Pune, the consumption of liquid oxygen has also increased from 55 metric tonnes per day, to 250 metric tonnes per day. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the availability of liquid oxygen is not a problem. He also stated that 12,000 Remdesivir injections will be available by Wednesday. “We have got sufficient stock of liquid oxygen with us. The oxygen production capacity in Pune is 325 metric tonnes per day. Right now we are consuming around 250 metric tonnes per day. In January our consumption was as low as 55 metric tonnes per day,” Rao said. Rao said that if a shortage of oxygen is noticed, then the administration has a plan B in place. “If daily production and consumption are almost the same, then we have a plan B in place, by which, industrial production of oxygen will be reduced and it will be dedicated for medical purposes. Last year we had started importing oxygen from Raigad. If needed, we will do the same. Presently, there is no oxygen crisis,” Rao said. As for complaints of a scarcity of Remdesivir, Rao said that more stock of the injections will be available by Wednesday. “There are many private hospitals which are complaining about the availability of Remedivisir. We have instructed all hospitals about hoarding of Remdesivir and judicious use of the same. We requested 12,000 injections from the joint director, FDA, on Tuesday. They are expected to be available Tuesday night. It will reduce the present scarcity,” Rao said. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

In the last 12 months since March 2020, pools were allowed for all for only two months in February and March 2021. In the month of November, only sportspersons were allowed to train. “The four months of February, March, April and May are important months for the business and in the rest of the eight months, financial management is done by the profit earned in four months,” said Narendra Acharekar, coach, Harmony Aquatic Club, Kothrud. In Pune, there are around 60 swimming pools where professionals and non- professionals practice swimming. Maintenance along with the payment of staff and electric bills costs around ₹45,000 which is spent on pools every month. “Even if the pool is not functional, you cannot skip maintenance. Every month the chemicals which are used to keep the water clean and swimming friendly costs around ₹25,000 need to be changed. We have somehow managed all this expenses for one year but if another long lockdown happens then it will put us in a big trouble because we cannot stop the payment of staff in lockdown as well,” said Acharekar. Along with non-professional swimmers, professionals who have upcoming tournaments in the coming months will miss the pool practice due to lockdown. “There are nationals in June and July and only physical exercise will not help swimmers from Pune so at least the government should allow competitive swimmers to train. It will help them a lot and some activity at pool will be also continued,” said Vinay Marathe, proprietor, Champion Aquatic Club, at Bal Gandharva. Sadhvi Dhuri who won five gold medals and one silver at the Khelo India University Games in February 2020 said, “Not all the swimmers can go out of the city to train so professional swimmers’ practice should be allowed. Last one year was tough and staying away from the pool for so many days affected the performance.” Lifeguards find it difficult to survive Rakesh Bhagat who has worked as a lifeguard at Harmony Aquatic Club since 2009 fears a repeat of the 2020 lockdown. “It was worse, I got married in February 2020 and the state was under lockdown from March. I thank Acharekar sir for taking care of my house rent and providing me with groceries. My livelihood can only come on track when pools will remain active. The current situation of helplessness invites suicidal thoughts to minds,” said Bhagat who is unable to find other jobs due to the Covid crisis. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Most toddlers infected with Covid-19 don’t have symptoms, but have a high viral load and may be silent spreaders in the community, according to a new study out of Hong Kong.Everyone in the U.K. will be urged to take a coronavirus test twice a week as a new system of Covid passports is assessed for wide-scale use under Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to reopen the economy. New York’s vaccination program picked up speed last week, with the most populous U.S. city reporting a record of more than a half-million doses administered.South Africa agreed to buy 20 million shots of the Pfizer Inc. vaccine, Business Day reported. Brazil expects to vaccinate 2 million people per day next month, according to its Senate president.Toddlers May Be Silent Spreaders: Hong Kong Study Most toddlers infected with Covid-19 don’t have symptoms, but have a high viral load and a long duration of live viral shedding, making them potential silent spreaders of the infection in the community, according to a study by the Faculty of Medicine at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.To identify any hidden transmission chain, the authors recommend testing stool samples from young children. “While we are working intensively to prevent high-risk individuals from being infected, it is important to come up with a solution to avoid unfavorable outcomes in young children,” said Siew Chien Ng, associate director of the university’s Centre for Gut Microbiota Research.New Zealand, Australia to Open Travel Bubble This Month New Zealand has agreed to open a quarantine-free travel corridor with Australia as of April 19, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday, restoring unrestricted, two-way travel across the Tasman Sea for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began.“The bubble will give our economic recovery a boost and represents a world leading arrangement of safely opening up international travel while continuing to pursue a strategy of elimination and keeping the virus out,” Ardern said. “We have worked hard to ensure travel is safe and that the necessary public health measures are in place.”Before the pandemic, Australian visitors accounted for one-quarter of the revenue New Zealand generated from foreign tourists. New Zealand has consistently topped Bloomberg’s Covid resilience ranking and Australia currently lies third, but both have suffered sporadic outbreaks requiring regional lockdowns.

              " ' Why don’t voters value health care?  You get what you ask for. With several states in election mode, the obvious question is — what are people asking for? If the citizens of India are not getting what they need on health, education and other social policy fronts, are they are not asking for them?Data from the CSDS-Lokniti 2019 post-poll survey highlighted development as the most important priority for voters (14.3% of voters surveyed), followed by unemployment, price rise, corruption and economy. Health/hospital facilities were mentioned as a key issue by a mere 0.3% of the sample. The 2014 post-poll survey had similar results, with health mentioned by 0.4% of the sample as a key priority.Assembly polls seem to be no different. Lokniti’s Bihar post-poll data from the 2020 assembly elections shows development, unemployment/jobs/recruitment/lack of industries, and inflation to be the top three issues for voters. Health was important for 0.3% of the respondents. A pre-poll survey for Delhi highlighted development, employment/unemployment/lack of jobs, education and nationalism as key issues. The 2016 pre-poll survey in Kerala found 0.2% of people surveyed rating health care as the most important issue for their voting choice. Clearly, health doesn’t seem to be a priority driving voting behaviour. This is not surprising, it may be argued, in a context where citizens lack the basics of income, water and roads. Where it is indeed surprising, however, is in the context of the financial implications of health care.Health-related expenditures are estimated to push approximately 3.5% of the population below the poverty line every year; with those below the poverty line pushed deeper into poverty. Research by Anirudha Krishna across India, Africa and Latin America found health-related expenses to be the prime reason for households descending into poverty (even when income had been secure to begin with) and that millions of households live “one illness away” from poverty. This means that even as citizens (rightly) prioritise income, health-related expenditures can so easily and dramatically change the economic status of households. Better health systems and services are key to prevent this health-related descent into poverty; yet this is not an electoral ask from citizens.The reality is that the middle-class has exited from the use of public services. Increasingly, the poor are moving in the same direction, towards private health and education services, with 70% of in-patient care and 80% of ambulatory services provided by the private sector. In such a situation, who then will demand better public health services?At a macro-level, research has highlighted the links between building human capital (through health and education) and growth. For a large number of Indian citizens, health, education, and nutritional levels constrain effective participation in many sectors, positioning them not merely as welfare issues, but equally a potential influencer of India’s growth, but health still does not find adequate place in India’s growth strategy. With little citizen-demand, and limited appreciation of the health-economy link, it is not surprising that political and electoral attention to health has been limited. This has resulted in India’s health having one of the lowest public investments at approximately 1.3% of the Gross Domestic Product; disproportionate use of private services which are extremely fragmented, with solo providers and individual clinics comprising 95% of the private ambulatory market; and 64% of health care expenditure being out-of-pocket at the point of service.It is not that policy solutions are not known. It is rather a case of health losing out as a priority in the heavily-contested policy space; a space driven by political incentives. The incentives to develop a strong health system, with benefits at the household as well as national/state level, are obvious; yet, political priority in this direction remains elusive. Other countries, as also some Indian states, have understood the electoral significance of health. Reforms in Turkey, Mexico, Thailand (to name just a few) were built on an electoral foundation. Priority to health insurance schemes in India has been linked with electoral gains. Yet, attention to the health sector in any meaningful manner has not been visible.This gives rise to several questions. Is building human capital not viewed as nation-building, and, thus, lacks political primacy? Does India’s federal and multi-layered governance system prevent clarity on who gets credit from health care services, diffusing potential electoral gains? Or is reforming the health care system too long-term an agenda, not conducive to immediate electoral gains, which are easier with health benefits delivered in a clientelist mode? For citizens, is a health crisis a sporadic emergency over which they have no control (in an almost fatalistic way), because of which responsibility for health care is neither accorded to themselves nor their leaders?Admittedly, the battlefield of elections seems to be increasingly moving away from the direct issues that impact the quality of life of citizens. Identity as an electoral issue, long dominant, but now predominant, has taken on newer forms such as nationalism, driving voter behaviour in a direction further away from issues of health, education, and social protection. More needs to be done to ensure that first, citizens understand the location and primacy of health in their aspirational journey and its impact on their economic status, and ask for better health care, and second, that national and state leaders acknowledge the role of health in a nation and State’s economic journey.

              " ' Masks, ventilation stop Covid-19 spread better than social distancing: Study  Masks and a good ventilation system are more important than social distancing for reducing the airborne spread of COVID-19 inside a room, a modelling study suggests. In the research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, the researchers created a computer model of a classroom with students and a teacher.They then modelled airflow and disease transmission, and calculated airborne-driven transmission risk. The classroom model was 709 square feet with 9-foot-tall ceilings, similar to a smaller-size classroom. The model had masked students -- any one of whom could be infected -- and a masked teacher at the front of the classroom.\"The research is important as it provides guidance on how we are understanding safety in indoor environments,\" said Michael Kinzel, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida in the US.\"The study finds that aerosol transmission routes do not display a need for six feet social distancing when masks are mandated,\" Kinzel said.The study highlights that with masks, transmission probability does not decrease with increased physical distancing, which emphasises how mask mandates may be important to increasing capacity in schools and other places, according to the researchers.The team examined the classroom using two scenarios -- a ventilated classroom and an unventilated one -- and using two models, Wells-Riley and Computational Fluid Dynamics.Wells-Riley is commonly used to assess indoor transmission probability and Computational Fluid Dynamics is often used to understand the aerodynamics of cars, aircraft and the underwater movement of submarines.Masks were shown to be beneficial by preventing direct exposure of aerosols, as they provide a weak puff of warm air that causes aerosols to move vertically, thus preventing them from reaching adjacent students, Kinzel said.The researchers noted that a ventilation system in combination with a good air filter reduced the infection risk by 40 to 50 per cent compared to a classroom with no ventilation.This is because the ventilation system creates a steady current of air flow that circulates many of the aerosols into a filter that removes a portion of the aerosols compared to the no-ventilation scenario where the aerosols congregate above the people in the room.These results corroborate recent guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that recommend reducing social distancing in elementary schools from six to three feet when mask use is universal, Kinzel said.\"If we compare infection probabilities when wearing masks, three feet of social distancing did not indicate an increase in infection probability with respect to six feet, which may provide evidence for schools and other businesses to safely operate through the rest of the pandemic,\" Kinzel said.The results suggest exactly what the CDC is doing, that ventilation systems and mask usage are most important for preventing transmission and that social distancing would be the first thing to relax, the researcher added.

              " ' Domestic passenger traffic slips to 10-year low in pandemic-hit FY21  India\\'s domestic passenger traffic slipped to a 10-year low at an estimated 53.4 million in the just-concluded financial year, a report said. However, in the previous fiscal there were no passenger flight operations for almost two months due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. During the financial year 2010-11, all domestic air operators together had flown a total of 53.8 million passengers on local routes, according to ratings agency ICRA. The domestic passenger traffic in March 2021 has been estimated at around 77-78 lakh, a marginal decline of about 1 per cent over February during which airlines had flown around 78.30 lakh passengers, it said. “For FY2021 (May 25, 2020 till March 31, 2021), domestic passenger traffic has been pegged at around 53.4 million, a year-on-year decline of about 62 per cent over the fiscal ended March 31, 2020, in line with ICRA\\'s estimates,” it said. Domestic passenger traffic in March 2021 has been estimated at around 77-78 lakh, implying a flat growth on a y-o-y basis on a low base of March 2020 (which had witnessed a y-o-y decline of 33.1 per cent in domestic passenger traffic) as domestic travel was affected with effect from March 25, Icra said. Domestic passenger traffic witnesses a flat year-on-year growth in March 2021 owing to low base, Icra said, adding the recent spike in cases poses challenge for sector\\'s recovery. The airlines\\' capacity for March 2021 was around 2 per cent higher at around 71,300 departures than 69,910 departures in March. On a sequential basis, the number of departures in March 2021 were higher by about 11 per cent, Icra said. For March, the average daily departures were around 2,300, higher than the average daily departures of 2,255 in March 2020, owing to cessation of domestic travel for the last seven days of the month previous fiscal, and marginally higher than around 2,296 in February this year, said Kinjal Shah, Vice President ICRA. Domestic scheduled passenger services were suspended from March 25, 2020 to curb the pandemic, and were resumed only from May 25, 2020. The average number of passengers per flight during March 2021 was 109, against an average of 111 passengers per flight in March 2020, she said, adding, it is, therefore, expected that the domestic aviation industry operated at a passenger load factor (PLF) of around 72 per cent in March 2021, against a PLF of 73.1 per cent in March 2020, which was also impacted by the pandemic. \"The PLF for March 2021 was lower than the around 79 per cent in February 2021, due to the increase in capacity deployment by about 11 per cent. Overall, for FY2021, domestic passenger traffic has been pegged at around 53.4 million, declining 62 per cent over FY 2020 traffic,” Shah said.

              " ' ‘Any solution in Afghanistan without Taliban runs risk of failure’: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov  Any process to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan that excludes the Taliban runs the risk of failure, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday after talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.“The Taliban movement is part of Afghan society, and decisions on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups of Afghanistan. Otherwise, it’s not going to be stable,” Lavrov told a joint press conference in response to a question on a possible power-sharing agreement with the Taliban.The latest developments in Afghanistan figured prominently in the meeting between the two ministers, who shared their assessments on the situation in the war-torn country. Lavrov’s delegation included Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan and a key player in Moscow’s reconciliation efforts.Lavrov said he and his Indian counterpart agreed the Russian and Indian representatives on Afghanistan will be in close contact regularly, while Jaishankar pointed out that “what happens in Afghanistan impacts [India’s] security directly”.“This decision has to be based on the balance of political and ethnic and religious interests... Any other way that foresees the exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to agreements that could be implementable and sustainable. All of this would be fraught with the risk of the resumption of the hostilities, which is not anybody’s desire,” he added.Jaishankar said India’s approach hinges on durable peace in Afghanistan, which would “require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country”. He added, “The peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe, and a political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.”Lavrov said he hoped the Biden administration would implement the agreement the Trump administration signed with the Taliban last year as it had “created a window of opportunity to reach an agreement between all the hostile parties”. Russia is ready to arrange further consultations under the “Moscow Format”, which includes India, China and Pakistan, to give impetus to the peace process, he said.People familiar with developments, said on condition of anonymity, that there was a frank exchange of assessments by both sides regarding the situation in Afghanistan, especially after the US administration’s fresh push for peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The Indian side highlighted its concerns about any hasty power-sharing agreement undoing the gains of the past two decades, the people said.India has been facing calls in recent years from leaders in the US, Russia and Iran to engage with the Taliban, though the government in New Delhi is yet to take a call on the issue. Questions were raised when Russia didn’t include India in a meeting of the “extended troika” in Moscow last month, especially after Pakistan was invited to the meet that included Taliban representatives. Lavrov headed to Pakistan from India, and his itinerary raised eyebrows in New Delhi as it is virtually unheard of for a Russian leader to travel to Islamabad from New Delhi.Lavrov also didn’t have an interaction with the Indian prime minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader. The people cited above sought to play down the matter, saying no such meeting was scheduled as the prime minister was away in West Bengal to address public meetings at Cooch Behar and Howrah as part of the BJP’s campaign for the state elections.There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions. While growing political and defence cooperation between Russia and China have sparked speculation about a potential military alliance between the two countries, Lavrov ruled out such a possibility.He said Russia-China summits had concluded that bilateral relations “are at the highest [point] in the history but these relations do not pursue a goal of establishing a military alliance”. Lavrov added, “By the way, we’ve heard speculations about pro-military alliances not only regarding Russia-China relations but also about such alliances allegedly being promoted such as ‘Middle East NATO’ and... ‘Asian NATO’. Today, we exchanged views on this and Indian friends have the same position as us. We believe that this is counter-productive and we are interested in inclusive cooperation that is for something, and not against somebody.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' \\'Red hot investment\\': US Envoy John Kerry lauds India\\'s energy policy  US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry lauded India\\'s efforts to emerge as a global leader in renewable energy with some of the biggest companies signing a declaration on climate change and pledging to go carbon neutral.Kerry is on a four-day visit to India, from April 5 to April 8, during which he will meet representatives from the Union government, the private sector and NGOs.\"India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve. You (India) are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy,\" Kerry said. Kerry was speaking in Delhi, where he held talks with government leaders as part of a diplomatic effort to get countries to commit themselves to net zero carbon emissions and slow down global warming.\"India, in particular, is a red hot investment opportunity because of its clean energy transition. Indian industry is already stepping up and demonstrating leadership,\" US envoy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Kerry pointed out how a recent International Energy Agency\\'s special report on India noted that that the country is on pace to become global market leader in solar and storage by 2040. \"Thanks to your rapid scale-up, it is already cheaper to build solar energy in India than anywhere else in the world,\" Kerry said.Kerry was accompanied by a seven-member US delegation in the talks, an environment ministry official said.Praising Prime Minister Narendr Modi\\'s policy goals on renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said that the announcement of a target of 450 GW of renewables by 2030 sets a very strong example of power how to power a growing economy with clean energy.Decisive action by India, Kerry said, in partnership with the rest of the world will determine what this transformation will mean for generations to come.Striking a comparision between US and India, Kerry said that India has an advantage that US did not have during the developing stage. \"Not just benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement, you also have US as your friend and partner. We\\'re here to support you through this path of sustainable future,\" Kerry said.Backing India\\'s efforts across the spectrum globally, Kerry said that the country\\'s global leadership has been critical across a range of issues including delivering Covid-19 vaccines to world.This is also Kerry\\'s first visit to India as the US Special Envoy for Climate Change. In January, the Biden administration had re-joined the Paris Agreement.The visit aims at consultations on increasing climate ambition ahead of Biden\\'s Leaders\\' Summit on Climate scheduled for April 22-23 and the COP26 meet to be held later this year.US President Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to a US-hosted virtual summit on climate to underscore the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.This will be the second time PM Modi and US President Biden will be together at a virtual summit after last month\\'s Quad meeting.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India is the third-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide, after China and the US, despite extremely low per capita CO2 emissions.It has set a target of achieving 175GW (gigawatt) of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450GW by 2030.(With inputs from agencies) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics india climate research renewable energy john kerry joe biden prime minister narendra modi + 3 more ',\n",
              " ' Maoism remains India’s biggest internal security threat  In one of the bloodiest battles fought between the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and security forces in the Terram jungle of Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district, 22 elite fighters from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and its elite Cobra battalion, District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives along with, reportedly, an equal number of Maoists. The five-hour-long fierce encounter on Saturday witnessed the use of light machine guns and AK-47s by the Maoists, with security forces responding in equal measure, deploying under-barrel grenade launchers and mortars against targets picked up by Heron (an unmanned aerial vehicle). Most deaths and injuries took place when, during the fierce phase of the firefight, security personnel moved the wounded to the huts at Tekulgudam village, unaware that the village along with two others, Jeera Gaon and Jonaguda, had been vacated on the diktat of the Maoists in a well-planned strategy. Once the force was trapped, relentless fire from the enemy positions caused further damage.This was part of a joint operation launched by the districts of Bijapur and Sukma on late Friday night, on reliable information about the presence of the dreaded Maoist commander in the area, Madvi Hidma. The operation was aimed at targeting multiple locations, and comprised around 2,000 security personnel. The group, which was targeted by the Maoists, was 450-men strong. They did not walk into a trap. Nor were they ambushed. A movement of 2,000 men would surely alert the Maoists and the force has to be prepared for such exigencies. The Heron would have picked up Maoist movements — so it was a fair and square fight where equal numbers were lost on both sides. An enquiry will reveal the real truth and the lapses of strategy and tactics. But the security personnel displayed grit and valour, fighting heroically for five hours till the Maoists broke their ranks and retreated.This is yet another grim reminder of the capability of Maoist cadres to lie low for long periods, regroup and strike at intervals. An improvised explosive device (IED) mine blasted a bus carrying security men last month, killing three. In March 2020, in an ambush in Sukma, the Maoists killed 17 security personnel.The downward trend of Maoist violence over the last few years has led the government and some security analysts to declare that the battle against Maoism (or Naxalism, as the terms are interchangeably used) is almost won. According to the annual report of the ministry of home affairs (MHA), Maoist violence was restricted to 251 police stations (PS) in 60 districts of eight states in 2018, in comparison with 330 PSs in 76 districts of 10 states in 2013. In the first half of 2020, it was restricted to 46 districts. The incidents of violence (670) and deaths of security personnel were the lowest in 2019, as per the available official figures.Despite data revealing an overall reduction in violence, the capacity of Left-wing extremists to retaliate with ferocity indicates that Maoism still remains the biggest threat to our internal security, almost 11 years after then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged and framed the scale of threat in exactly this manner. Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand lie in the eye of the storm. Out of 670 incidents of Naxal violence in 2019, 463, ie 69%, occurred in these two states. The Maoists are entrenched in the jungles in these two states, and intelligence agencies, at great risk, glean their activities and plans, as deliberated upon in their central committee meetings, and share it with other central forces and state police.But if statistics belie the real situation on the ground, what is lacking in the government’s approach towards fighting Maoism? Is a course-correction in combat strategy also desired? First, senior police commanders will have to rethink the rationale of large-scale operations. The stakes are too high and heavy losses of men are causes of serious worry. It is important to change tactics according to the situation. The Greyhounds of undivided Andhra Pradesh, a specialised force that achieved great success in weakening the Maoists, conducted their operations with small-sized teams, acting on pinpoint intelligence. Even their platoon strength team had a clear chain of command.Second, there is a complete administrative and security vacuum in such areas to counter the Janatana Sarkar of Maoists run through their Revolutionary People Committee (RPC), equivalent to gram panchayats. For instance, allegations abound of RPCs seizing grains distributed under the public distribution system and distributing it under their aegis. The erosion of State authority is also reflected in the fact that civilians often act as the eyes and ears of the Maoists in affected areas. While extending roads and hoisting mobile towers have certainly helped, CRPF will have to set up its camps deeper in the jungles. The Rural Roads Programme (RRP) aimed at constructing 5,411 kms and connecting 44 Naxal-affected districts, must also be speeded up as most of these districts fall in Chhattisgarh.And, finally, managing India’s internal security cannot be a part-time job. There are too many challenges, and too many critical decisions to be made on a regular basis. An internal security ministry needs to be hived off from the MHA — the secretary of the ministry must be a specialist, either a serving or retired police officer of outstanding reputation, and this must be supervised by a full-time minister who is hands-on. This cannot afford to wait any longer.Yashovardhan Azad is a former IPS officer, who served as Central Information Commissioner, secretary, security and special director, Intelligence Bureau.

The designated containment zones have also increased accordingly and reached 3,291, the health bulletin showed.The surge in daily cases recorded - up from Monday's 3,548 - comes as the authorities decided to ramp up the testing and tracing strategy in a bid to contain the rising infections.Earlier in the day, Delhi government imposed a night curfew that will be in place every day from 10pm to 5am in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases in the national Capital.During the seven-hour curfew period, movement of only government officials, healthcare workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed.“The situation of Covid-19 in NCT of Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a sudden increase in Covid-19 cases in recent past along with high positivity rate and therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi from 10pm to 5am, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure for well being and safety of people,” read the order issued by acting chief secretary Satya Gopal on behalf of the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA).It will be in force till April 30 or until further orders.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had confirmed that the city-state is witnessing the fourth wave of infections, even as the rest of the country is reeling from the second wave.“For the rest of the country, one may call it the second wave. But for Delhi, this is the fourth wave. We are heading towards the fourth peak. This wave is witnessing an exponential increase in cases and spreading very fast. It is concerning but there is nothing to panic because this wave is also less severe in terms of number of deaths and cases that require hospitalisation, admission to ICU, etc,” Kejriwal said at a digital news briefing.Delhi witnessed its first wave in June, followed by the second in September and the third wave in November, which has been the worst so far, with the highest case tally of 8,593.

              " ' Health minister says Covid-19 surge can be contained if people follow rules  Union minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday held a meeting with health ministers of 11 states and union territories (UTs) where her urged them to request people to follow Covid-19 preventative measures. Harsh Vardhan told the health ministers that if people adhere to Covid-19 preventative measures then the recent surge of the infection can be contained. Watch Now!Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan holds a VC with Health Ministers of 11 states to review the #COVID19 situation & actions being taken to address rising cases in the country.@PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA https://t.co/vKe6m14Enx— DrHarshVardhanOffice (@DrHVoffice) April 6, 2021 Health ministers of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan attended the virtual meeting on Tuesday.Harsh Vardhan said, “We are still in control of the situation. The strategy that led to decline of cases earlier in February this year, when the nation reported 8,635 cases, if we revisit the strategy then we may be able to contain this current spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. We need to motivate society to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.” The Union health minister pointed out that the steep rise that was reported since February came from these 11 states and UTs. Vardhan also said that Chattisgarh remains one of the worst-affected states. He said that Durg and Raipur in Chhattisgarh are badly affected as the positivity rate in these two districts have gone up to 20%. The minister also talked about Haryana’s small towns which he said are badly affected by the latest surge. Harsh Vardhan said that the UK variant contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases across Punjab, along with events like marriages and local body polls.He also said that the Centre has sent 50 teams to Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab - the three states where Covid-19 is wreaking havoc. He said that 30 teams will be stationed in Maharashtra, while districts in Punjab and Chhattisgarh which are reporting a surge in cases will be under the supervision of 9 and 11 teams respectively. The teams will focus on implementing the testing, tracking, treating, vaccination and strategies to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol among people. The teams will report to the state and Centre with their recommendations on a daily basis.“Following gradual reopening of services, people took a casual approach towards following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour which has led to a surge in the number of cases. There were elections held previously, elections are also being held currently, there are Kumbh festivities going on, offices have reopened in several cities and social functions like marriages and other events have been taking place in higher frequency where people have not followed Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the health minister said.The health minister also pointed out that he has personally also seen people not wearing masks while they were outside. He said that there are several ‘social vaccines’ like proper usage of masks and hand sanitisers which are available along with the real vaccines \"so taking care of the surge should not pose a major challenge if people can be forced to follow these rules\".India witnessed the highest surge in daily cases on Monday when the daily caseload crossed 100,000-mark. India currently has 788,233 active cases and the death toll has reached 165,547 with 446 fresh fatalities reported on Tuesday.

              " ' Democracy, Israel’s prized possession, is facing a grave risk  Israel is known for its hard power — conjuring up images of its military strength, intelligence apparatus, arms diplomacy, and a developed economy. Israel achieved all of these in the last seven decades, in spite of its existential issues since 1948 amid multiple regional wars. Since soft power is also an important consideration, Israel has presented itself, legitimately, as the only democracy in West Asia.But the last four elections in Israel — in April and September 2019, March 2020 and on March 23, 2021 — have exposed the inner workings of its democracy. Among leading democracies, Israel now has had the most frequent number of national elections in recent years, and its democratically elected governments have survived for an average of 2.3 years rather than a four-year term since 1996. In the last two years, Israel has gone to the polls four times, and it may well go for a fifth round if there is no one leader capable of forming a coalition government with 61 seats (out of 120 total seats in parliament). Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party, Likud, has 30 seats, but he is opposed by a variety of different political leaders who are otherwise of the same ideological bent such as Benny Gantz, Yair Lapid or Gideon Saar.Netanyahu once worked well with all these leaders at different times but now faces stiff resistance. He is also going through a legal trial for three criminal cases — bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Looking at the major issues and slogans of the last four elections, it is clear that Israeli society is polarised on one big issue — are you with Netanyahu or against him? All other issues — from Covid-19 and its severe impact on the Israeli economy to the lack of an annual budget since 2018, from rising prices to the fact that Israel has high unemployment — have all got relegated to the background as the electorate stands deeply divided over Netanyahu, who has served more than a decade as prime minister.Netanyahu has refused to resign from office or leave politics until his name is cleared by the court. He fought this election while on trial and he may very well stake claim to form the government soon. What makes him so indispensable within certain pockets of Israeli society is his perceived strong position on security and his diplomatic acumen. National security plays a crucial role in Israeli domestic politics as well as in its foreign policy. Henry Kissinger once said that Israel does not have a foreign policy, but domestic politics which is over-concerned with security. Netanyahu has projected himself as a leader who will fight the world for Israel and the Jews, and has navigated international politics to ensure that Israel does not have to accept a two-state solution on the Palestinian issue. His followers rate him highly for ensuring American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and for the Abraham Accords, which led to a a rapprochement with Arab states such as United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. His excellent personal relationship with leaders such as Narendra Modi and Vladimir Putin is seen as a source of strength for Israel. On the charges of corruption, his followers think they are conspiracies.Israeli will do well with a democratic State rather than a narrowly defined security-military-capable State. For long, Israel has focused on carving out domestic unity around the issue of fighting the external enemy. But some crises are internal. Israel needs to look within and find ways to overcome its domestic political deadlock and find common ground between its liberal social norms and an increasingly inward and polarised polity.

              " \" Aakash Chopra names team which ‘can give competition to MI’ in IPL 2021  Former Indian opener Aakash Chopra feels that Rishabh Pant-led Delhi Capitals (DC) is a strong team that can give tough competition to defending champions Mumbai Indians (MI) in the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).The Delhi-based franchise were the runners-up of IPL 2020 as they lost to Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians by 5 wickets in the season finale. Interestingly, DC had failed to defeat MI in all four of their encounters last season. But now, they are keen to start afresh under the leadership of newly-appointed skipper Rishabh Pant.In the latest video on his YouTube channel, Aakash Chopra highlighted the strengths of DC and said that the Rishabh Pant-led side is capable of posing a tough challenge to the five-time champions.“This team has a lot of strengths. This is one of my favourite sides, which looks strong on paper. They can give competition to the Mumbai Indians. They have all the bases covered in terms of their balance,” said Chopra.ALSO READ | 'Played with a lot of Englishmen, Australians, West Indians, they just give up on mental health': Ganguly on bio bubbles“Their biggest strength is their Indian core.

              " ' Div commissioner asks state govt for additional 165 regular ventilators, 22 paediatric ventilators  PUNE Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has sent a proposal to the state government on Tuesday, asking for an additional 187 ventilators for the Pune division. The request is for 165 regular ventilators and 22 paediatric ventilators. According to Rao there is a slight spike in the paediatric cases as compared to last year. Of the 165 regular ventilators which have been requested, 100 will be for Pune district. “Bed availability is a crisis because of the multi-fold increases in inflow of patients. In my proposal to the state government I have asked for 165 regular ventilators for the division, of which, 100 ventilators will be for Pune district. This includes the four units which are civil surgeon Pune, government medical college Pune, PMC and PCMC. We are working on many options to increase availability of beds, like increasing beds in private hospitals,” said Rao. “On Monday we added 439 beds and on Tuesday we are adding 400 more beds. So we will have more beds,” Rao said. After the correspondence between district administration and Army officials, the Army is expected to declare a dedicated Covid hospital available by Wednesday. “I have spoken to the Army authorities. They have given positive feedback. By Tuesday night or Wednesday, they are going to declare at least one hospital belonging to the Army as a Covid hospital. I have personally spoken to minister Prakash Javdekar so that he speaks to the defence minister to facilitate the process,” Rao said. Rao also revealed that there has been a slight increase in paediatric Covid cases. “We have also asked for 22 paediatric ventilators. There is a slight spike in paediatric cases. As a precaution, we want to have a sufficient number of paediatric ventilators available. On Monday we got a case where there was a three-month old baby who was Covid positive. In the first wave there were very few paediatric cases. We are expecting that we will get these by Wednesday,” Rao said. Beds availableThe availability of beds in Pune had slightly improved on Tuesday. On Sunday and Monday no ICU and ventilator beds were available in Pune city. On Tuesday evening, the dashboard revealed that 12 ICU beds with ventilators and 12 ICU beds without ventilators were available. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Pakistan will take a decade to vaccinate 75% population: Report  Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Pakistan, a report published in an American publication has said that Islamabad will take around a decade to vaccinate 75 per cent of its population in contrast with the developed countries which would take a much shorter period.According to a Bloomberg report cited by Arab News, countries like the US, Britain and Israel were likely to reach the 75 percent target within three months while others like Pakistan were expected to immunise the same level of their population in about a decade. As per the same report, India will acquire herd immunity through vaccination in a little over three years.This comes amid the rising number of cases in Pakistan which has lead to increased restrictions, broader lockdowns and stronger standard operating procedures.\"Increased restrictions, broader lockdowns and stronger sops (Standard operating procedure) enforcement are starting to have effect. Initial signs of positivity slowing. However, due to momentum of last 2 weeks patients on critical care and mortality will stay at high levels for some time. Please follow sops and be safe,\" Asad Umar, chairman of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) tweeted.The latest report also said that countries like Germany and France were likely to acquire herd immunity through vaccination in about a year.Taking Pakistan\\'s current situation in account, the report also raised concern over the issue due to the \"general indifference to medical problems once they stop bothering rich countries.\"As many as 3953 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country has reached 696,184.Amid the growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 ahead of Ramadan, Pakistan last Sunday had reported 3,568 coronavirus patients, who are under critical care.

              " ' Don’t know if we’re ready for Asian Champions League: FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando  “My muscles are very, very tired. This is for me a big problem,” said Juan Ferrando, palms turned up. Recovering from Covid-19, the 40-year-old FC Goa coach’s agony at not being 100% though is nothing compared to the ecstasy of playing in the Asian Champions League. Players have complained of cabin fever and have spoken of being away from families for over six months, but everytime the Spaniard hears such conversations, “I tell them, “stop it, stop it, you are in the Champions League”.”Along with Iran’s Persepolis, runners-up last year, Qatar’s Al Rayyan and the winners of Al Wahda (UAE) and Al-Zawraa (Iraq) qualifier, FC Goa complete group E. They will be the first Indian team at Asian football’s high table. Goa will host this group, and ahead of their April 14 opener against Al Rayyan, coached by 1998 French World Cup-winning centre-back Laurent Blanc, Ferrando shared his views in a virtual interview. Excerpts:How does it feel to be in charge of the first Indian team in the Champions League group stages?It’s a lot of responsibility. It’s my first time in India and in this club. After six months, I know the players and the club but it’s a big responsibility because this is not a local competition but an international one. It will be like a presentation of Indian football to the world. All the players have to be focused to work like a team, to be ready for 90 minutes. The most important thing is to take everything day by day. It’s not just about the first or the second game; there are six games (in 16 days), all of which are very important for us.ALSO READ | Working from home, Juan Ferrando gets ready for FC GoaDoes it help that you are playing at home?(It helps) when you have supporters. When the stadium is empty, you play here, at Stamford Bridge or at Old Trafford, it’s the same. Statistics show that normally teams that play at home win more but now without supporters, the balance is similar. (FC Goa skipper Edu Bedia told a media conference on Tuesday that the weather would be an advantage).In Indian Super League (ISL), FC Goa got points after trailing, but also conceded 23 goals in the league phase. How ready is the team defensively?It’s difficult but we are thinking of playing the same style. If we concede one goal, our target is to do two. Okay, I understand the big squad of the opponents and we do need to work more in defence and run more but the responsibility is not only for (goalkeepers) Dheeraj (Singh), Naveen (Kumar), (defenders) Adil (Khan), James (Donachie). It lies with everyone. If Igor (Angulo) plays as No. 9, he is our first defence. If Ishan (Pandita) plays as No. 9, he is our first defence. Juan Ferrando((FC Goa)) Your group stage opponents have a lot of experience at this level.It’s very, very difficult. They have very good players and a lot of experience in this competition. For them, it is a big moment to play in the group stage and progress to the next round. For us, it’s a great opportunity to learn, get some experience, and for our local players, to know about an international competition. It’s different—you need to focus for 90 minutes, work like a team. In ISL, you have two-three players who have good crosses, good dribbling, they can help the team; in international competitions, you need to be a team, that’s very important.Does India losing 0-6 to UAE in a friendly add to the responsibility of taking an Indian team to the Champions League?When you lose games 6-0 or 5-0 it is difficult…sometimes I talk about this as it is a big responsibility because at the moment as a club we don’t know if we are ready to participate in this competition. My focus, of course, is now to prepare the club because it is a lot of games, six games in 20 (16) days. It is necessary to be strong here (points to his head).ALSO READ | Mumbai City FC pip FC Goa to enter ISL finalIn ISL, FC Goa tried to keep the ball and play out from the back. Can we expect the same in the Champions League?Around this time one year ago when I was talking to Akshay (Tandon, president) and Ravi (Puskur, director of football) they told me: “be clear, FC Goa wants to play in one style, in Champions League, ISL, the Super Cup next season”. Of course, we will change some details. Of course, it is necessary to focus on defence, details in build-up, pressing and position in attack. But the style, more or less, will be the same because it is in our mind. We love football in this way.Going into the competition what are the areas you need to improve?It is necessary to improve more in set-pieces because we know we have a problem, but this problem (FC Goa shipped 16 goals from set-pieces in ISL, the maximum among the semi-finalists) is not because they are bad players. Sometimes it is necessary to learn when you go zone (zonal marking), when you go man to man. We have a lot of young players who don’t know about these details.You have been in India for a season. What aspects do Indian teams need to improve in?The most important thing is to focus for 90 minutes. The difference between an Asian and European team is that a European team is working for 90 minutes and they forget the extra things. Here, for example, when a referee makes a decision, some players keep thinking about that for two or three minutes. Or, for example, when you want to make a substitution, the player often needs two-three minutes to understand his role once he enters the pitch. We need to improve in these points.ALSO READ | FC Goa look to tackle fixture pile-upBefore joining FC Goa, if someone had said you would be playing the Asian Champions League in 2021, what would you have said?When I was talking with Ravi, I never spoke about the salary. I said, “We will play in the Champions League, so it’s okay. Let’s go, let’s go.” It’s a pleasure. I have experience because I worked in the group stage of the Europa League. For me, it is the best moment in my life to participate in this competition. It’s a great moment for the players, the club and the country.

              " ' Confusion, fear, anger on day 1 of new restrictions for Pune’s traders, shop owners  PUNE It was total confusion for traders, shop owners and other businesspersons across the city on Tuesday, the first day of the new restrictions imposed in the state. Thousands of small shop owners opened up in various parts of Pune in the morning, most unaware about the new orders – only stores offering essential services were allowed to be open; and others who knew the orders, but decided not to follow it. Local district, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities and the police department went on the rounds of the city, appealing to shop owners and traders to shut their shops as per the new restrictions.“I opened up my shop as per my daily routine at 9 am and started cleaning, when suddenly a friend of mine came told me about the restrictions. If we are told to be shut till April 30 then it is very difficult to survive financially. I have rented this shop for ₹15,000 and am already going in a loss for the last one year,” said Ramesh Rathod, a cloth shop owner in Katraj. Umesh Chavan, owner of a stationary shop in Shivajinagar, said, “Government offices and their work is going on, and we are told to close down. To break the chain of Covid infection, closing shops is not the solution. I was aware that shops are to be closed, but I opened up today.”At Laxmi road and other major markets in the city, many traders and shop owners are opposed to this decision. “There is lot of anger amongst shop owners against this closing down of shops ahead of the festival and wedding seasons. Soon, Gudhipadwa, Ramnavmi and wedding seasons is to come. Last year we accepted it as Covid was new for every one of us, but now we cannot afford to keep the shops closed for a single day,” said Nitesh Chopada, secretary, Laxmi road Ganpati chowk traders association. Even the public is unhappy with the decision taken by the state government.Rasika Mehta, a working professional said, “Post lockdown of last year, slowly the entire ecosystem of markets, offices and industries is coming on track. And suddenly it is stopped by these new restrictions. We need to take safety precautions, but at the same we cannot put a break on the running economy of the state.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' India won\\'t open Covid-19 vaccination for all. Official explains why  Caught in a highly infectious wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), India launched a nationwide vaccination in January this year. As pointed out by experts, vaccination is India\\'s artillery against the viral contagion which has infected more than 12.5 million in the country.The strategy has been relied upon by chief ministers of all states who have also asked for increasing the ambit of the vaccinating programme. However, the Centre differs and has firmly stated that these drives will not be opened for all.Explaining it further, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a weekly press briefing on Tuesday, \"Many people ask why shouldn\\'t we open vaccination for all. There are two aims of such vaccination drives - to prevent deaths and protect the healthcare system.\"The aim, Bhushan said, is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. He later clarified his remark, saying the government was following a dynamic supply-demand mapping model.“The primary aim of vaccination is to reduce mortality among the most vulnerable class of people. Why did we prioritise some groups over others? Because in this phase of vaccination (till around July), vaccines will be in limited supply. Hence we have to prioritise it to the most vulnerable sections of society and this is an established practice across the world,” Bhushan told news agency ANI.Bhushan said that this prioritisation strategy of those more vulnerable is also backed by the WHO. \"Along with the prioritisation, we are following a dynamic supply-demand mapping model to take decisions of when to open up vaccinations to other age groups,\" the Union health secretary said.Also read: BMC announces fresh Covid-19 restrictions for Mumbai, in addition to Maharashtra govt curbsIndia, currently in its third phase of Covid-19 vaccination, has started vaccinating people above the age of 45. In the first phase, which started on January 16, India inoculated healthcare workers with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). The drive was further opened up to 20 million frontline workers from February 1 onwards.In the next phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, authorities aimed to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1. The vaccine drive was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories: healthcare workers, frontline workers, and those at greater risk from Covid-19 due to their age or existing medical conditions.The clarification from officials came a day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging relaxation in the age bar and opening of new vaccination centres.In his letter, Kejriwal suggested a two-pronged approach. \"First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centers. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centers need to be relaxed,\" he said.\"Second, it should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunization. Except for those who cannot get vaccinated medically, we should start vaccinating everyone. This will remove the hesitation among people and increase the number of people getting vaccinated. The more people get vaccinated, the more we will be able to reduce the spread of the disease,\" he added.Also read | Covid-19 pandemic in India has worsened, warnings were given: GovtThackeray in his letter reasoned that the move will benefit Maharashtra - the worst-affected state - and those vaccinated by reducing the severity among the young and working population falling in that age bracket.\"I request you to lower it to 25, as the states facing the surge are having to place curbs to safeguard the lives of the population. However, if a larger number of our young and working population is vaccinated, the intensity of the cases would be much lower than the treatment that they need today,\" Thackeray said in his letter.

              " ' Economic recovery still shallow, a month\\'s lockdown can dent GDP by 2%: Report  India\\'s economic recovery is still \"shallow\" and a month\\'s national lockdown to curb the rising pace of COVID-19 infections can dent the GDP by up to 2 per cent, an American brokerage warned on Tuesday.Analysts at BofA Securities said there has been a six-times increase in the number of infections to over 1.03 lakh, and state governments have responded with localised lockdowns till now.A national lockdown, which it reckoned as a \"last resort\", if declared, can have deep impact on the growth process, which is still \"shallow\", it said.\"We grow even more concerned that rising Covid-19 cases pose a risk to our still shallow recovery...We estimate that a month of national lockdown costs 100-200 bps of annual GDP. Needless to say, this also aggravates fiscal risks,\" it said.The country was kept under a lockdown to arrest the spread of COVID-19 infections last fiscal, which is going to be the primary reason for an over 7 per cent contraction in GDP. Analysts are expecting a double-digit GDP growth in FY22 on the base effect.The brokerage said the infections have crossed the peak and warned that the pace of rise in cases is picking up.In 2020, it took three months for cases to rise from 10,000 levels in mid-June to 90,000 levels in mid-September, whereas in this round, it has taken only six weeks.Overall testing continues to be far from adequate, it said, making it clear that the infections have not risen due to a jump in testing per se.The death rates are mercifully lower, it said, explaining that the 478 fatalities recorded on Monday were 42 per cent lower than what was observed when the daily cases were at the peak of 97,000.\"Given the high economic cost, we expect the Center and State governments to try to contain the spread with the tightening of Covid-19 regulations, night curfews and localized lockdowns,\" it said.\"It remains to be seen if this second wave of Covid 19 cases subsides without a national level lockdown,\" it added.In its base case, the brokerage continues to see a 9 per cent jump in the real gross value added growth for FY22, but there can be a 3 percentage point impact to the estimate in case of a national lockdown, it warned.

              " ' City hospitals report acute shortage of blood with restrictions, vaccinations affecting donors  PUNE Given the Covid-19 surge, city hospitals are now facing an acute shortage of blood. In addition to the restriction on movement, vaccination bars beneficiaries from donating blood for at least two months, which further slims the chances of people aged above 45 years from donating blood. Blood banks are now running dry.Dr Atul Kulkarni, director of Jankalyan Raktapedi, a blood bank in the city, said, “As of now we have 500 units of blood available with us which is enough for a week’s time, as we get demands for at least 80-90 units a day. We fear that in the coming days, we might have an acute shortage of blood, especially because of the existing lockdown and restrictions in place. All pre-planned blood donation camps have been postponed indefinitely, or cancelled. We get requests from thalassemic patients who need blood transfusion regularly, and also from emergency surgeries which cannot be delayed.”A senior doctor from Sassoon hospital said, “We are facing an acute shortage of blood. We have 150 units of blood currently and we need 45 donors every alternate day to sustain the current demand; 30-45 units of plasma and 20-40 units of platelets. Blood donation camps which were organised for the weekends have been cancelled due to the lockdown. If any society comes forward they can contact us and we will send our volunteers to collect blood. We have our vans which could be set up in any free space and two people can donate blood at a time.”Explaining the drop, the doctor said, “The surge in cases means more people are being infected who cannot donate blood right now. Also, the high number of people getting the vaccines is also a roadblock, because as per government guidelines a vaccinated person cannot donate blood for at least a month after the jab. So the eligibility criteria is further narrowed.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

The WWE wrestler and actor has time and again extended his support to the seven-member K-pop group. The Suicide Squad star has now opened up about how BTS and its fandom, popularly known as ARMY, have helped him through some tough times.Cena appeared on an international talk show to talk about his upcoming books titled Be a Work in Progress: And Other Things I’d Like to Tell My Younger Self and Do Your Best Every Day to Do Your Best Every Day: Encouraging Words from John Cena. During the chat, he said that he was experiencing a low phase four years ago, around the same time BTS released their album Love Yourself: Answers.

It was the island\\'s worst rail accident in seven decades.The truck had slid down a sloping road from a building site onto the tracks just outside a tunnel. Officials suspect the truck\\'s brakes were not properly applied and are investigating the manager of the site.Young Hong-tsu, chairman of Taiwan\\'s Transportation Safety Board, said they had reconstructed how the truck had ended up on the rails, tracking its movements down the dirt road before it slipped off a bank and landed on the railway line, its front end facing the oncoming train.Young showed recovered footage taken from inside the driver\\'s cabin as he desperately tried to slow down before hitting the truck at the entrance to the tunnel, causing the train to de-rail.\"How much time was there between this truck sliding onto the track and it hitting the Taroko express? Actually it was only a little bit more than one minute,\" he said, referring to the name of the train.Young said the driver had no time to properly slow the train and avoid the accident as he had only seconds to react, the truck being on a bend and not visible until it was too late.In a screenshot from the footage, the truck is clearly seen straddling the track, with leaves and branches sticking out of its front from when it slid down the wooded bank.The victims included two Americans and one French national.Young said Taiwanese authorities had been in touch with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and France\\'s transport safety body to see if they were interested in helping with the investigation.

              " ' Time to clean up Mumbai  It started with a bomb scare (near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia), turned into a murder (of Hiren Mansukh), revealed the dubious role of a discredited-yet-powerful police official (Sachin Vaze), led to the transfer of the city’s police chief (Param Bir Singh), triggered allegations about a massive extortion racket presided over by the state’s home minister (Anil Deshmukh), deepened cleavages in the ruling alliance (particularly between the Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena), led to multiple investigations by agencies on various facets of the episode (from the National Investigation Agency to the Central Bureau of Investigation), and has, finally, led to a political resignation (Mr Deshmukh). But this must not be the end of the story of the politics-crime saga that has been playing out in Mumbai. There is a danger, however, that with Mr Deshmukh’s resignation — he should have quit earlier, and finally put in his papers after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI probe into allegations against him — powerful political interests will seek to bury the matter. And as is characteristic of investigations in India, cases will get prolonged, the news cycle will move on, and all will be forgotten, except as a footnote in a larger story of how Mumbai is misgoverned. But that would be a lost opportunity, for no episode has, in recent times, opened up the possibility of cleaning up the dark networks that dominate Mumbai. There is, of course, a political subtext here. The Centre would like its agencies to focus only on the corruption allegations to add to the troubles within the ruling alliance, while Maharashtra’s government will underplay its own complicity and allege a conspiracy. But it is important to investigate the underlying structures of corruption at the bottom of the police structure and at the top of the polity — and how they intersect. Politicians use the police for political, financial and personal ends; police officials are happy to serve in return for protection, promotions, and a share of the benefits. Sometimes, one side overreaches — as Mr Vaze, either alone or with top-level sanction, did in this case. And that is when citizens learn of the utter mockery of the rule of the law in the city. Mumbai’s citizens deserve better. Police reforms would be a start. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Chinese travel rebounds during holiday while spending still lags  Residents made 102 million domestic trips over the three-day ‘Tomb-Sweeping’ holiday, up 145% from the same period last year when the country was still reeling from the initial pandemic outbreak. Travel was 95% of the level in 2019, before the pandemic, according to a government statement.Despite the recovery, spending was still well down, with tourism revenue reaching 27.2 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), or about 57% of the level in 2019. The data underscores just how reticent consumers are to spend, with private spending still lagging in the economy even as the industrial, export and real-estate sectors rebound.“The figures show that China’s domestic tourism market has basically recovered, and people feel confident about the containment of the virus,” said Veronica Wang, a partner at retail industry consultancy OC&C Strategy Consultants. The slower rebound in revenue was partly due to steep discounts offered by hotels and service providers, she added.The Qingming holiday is a traditional festival during which families travel back to their home towns to gather and pay their respects at their ancestors’ tombs. Many people put off traveling home during the Lunar New Year in February after Covid-19 outbreaks in Beijing and the adjacent Hebei province in January led to barriers to travel.Cinema salesHubei province, the original epicenter of the pandemic, reported 5.7 billion yuan in tourism revenue, 62% of 2019’s level, according to a statement by the local culture and tourism bureau. Shoppers in Shanghai spent 25.7 billion yuan between April 2 and April 4, a 6% improvement from 2019, local media reported.Box office revenue climbed to a record 814 million yuan, surpassing the 2019 tally of 695 million yuan, according to Chinese media reports. The newly released action blockbuster “Godzilla vs. Kong” raked in $137 million in the biggest foreign opening in China in at least 15 months.The upcoming five-day Labor Day holiday at the beginning of May will be the next key indicator of the strength of tourism and consumption’s recovery, Wang said. “Depending on the virus control conditions, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Labor Day holiday data surpasses that of 2019.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' From 1980 to 2021, the BJP’s journey  If there is one political story that captures the shift in Indian politics over the last four decades, it is that of the birth, failure, success, failure, and then even greater success of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On April 6, 1980, the BJP was born. While acknowledging its roots in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, in a sign that it would be distinct ideologically, the party adopted Gandhian socialism as one of its founding principles.The BJP, under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in the initial years, faltered electorally, which led to the rise of LK Advani as the party chief. Mr Advani steered the party towards Hindutva, the most powerful symbol of which was the Ram temple movement. This made secularism a contested word, spawned an entire generation of activists who are today at the top of the BJP leadership, and made the party one of the poles of Indian politics. But India wasn’t ready for this brand of politics, and it was by returning to Mr Vajpayee’s moderate avatar that the BJP was finally able to win power.The party, under Narendra Modi, is now the primary pole in Indian politics. It has become, arguably, even more committed to the Hindutva project, while appealing to the subaltern, expanding in newer areas, carving out multi-class and multi-caste alliances, and creating the most formidable election machine India has ever seen. Mr Modi said, on Tuesday, however, that BJP was not an election machine but a campaign to win over the hearts of citizens. This is an important message, but to truly operationalise it, the BJP must become a more inclusive party, reflecting India’s social diversity. It need not be socialist, but turning to Gandhi, as was originally pledged in 1980, will help. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Padma Shri educationist Gowri Ishwaran joins leadership board of VEGA Schools  New Delhi, Delhi, India – Business Wire IndiaLeading Indian ducationist and Padma Shri Awardee Gowri Ishwaran has recently joined the leadership board of India’s most promising new-age teaching and learning based educational institution. VEGA Schools is one of the top schools in Gurugram and is the first Indian school to be selected by the Global Schools Alliance (GSA) for its progressive & globally aligned ‘Problem based learning’ (PBL) teaching methodology, making it one of the world’s most innovative schools.The GSA is an alliance of 15 of the world’s most innovative schools from across the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Featuring in the GSA list as one of the best innovative and futurist teaching & learning institutions is no small feat for an Indian school that is leading the way forward, while disrupting the conventional teaching practices prevalent across schools in India with their progressive ‘Problem based learning’ (PBL) teaching and learning methodologies.As one of the most influential educators in India, Gowri Ishwaran has been credited with numerous accolades and has been responsible for mentoring, nurturing and enabling students with different skill sets, interests and capabilities to successes beyond academics. The Padma Shri Awardee and Founder Principal of Sanskriti School is also an advisor to the Shiv Nadar Foundation and has joined the leadership board of VEGA Schools, Gurugram. As a true educationist, her mission is to mentor and nurture young people to evolve into ethical leaders and change-makers of tomorrow. Mrs. Ishwaran’s own assessment of VEGA Schools unique PBL learning methodology finds validity and relevance for future change-makers to be nurtured and to succeed as she said, “I love the system that has been introduced at Vega Schools. To succeed in life you don’t always have to be an ‘A-lister’ where marks are concerned, but you have to be an ‘A-lister’ in other fields as well. And to succeed, just the content knowledge is not enough. It is how you communicate, how you deliver, what your thoughts are, your level of creativity and where your interests lie.”The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is being felt across educational institutions and schools across the world currently. However, it has already highlighted the challenges that lie ahead globally, as well as for the Indian job market.As everyone moves towards a new world, the parameters of guaranteeing a student’s future success are now increasingly being attributed to superior development and application of 21st Century capabilities and skills, and not just on marks or grades alone as a measure of future success of a student. Gowri Ishwaran further states, “In India, by and large, it has been a rote learning methodology. So, the kind of content you develop through rote learning, it doesn’t really give you any indication of the level of understanding. Success is not achieved only through marks. There are children who are academically inclined and will get good marks, and there are other children who are not academically inclined but have other talents. So you have to actually judge a child by the kind of ability or talent that he or she has. While there are students who have done very well for themselves, who have been academically bright and have risen to the top of their careers, but they have always been very innovative and creative, even in school.”Highlighting the need to adopt progressive and innovative teaching and learning methodologies that will determine personal and professional success in future, Mrs. Ishwaran provided insights on how exams and marks alone cannot measure future success. In a recent webinar with Sandy Hooda, Co-Founder of VEGA Schools, Mrs. Ishwaran meticulously highlighted the need for overhauling the current Indian education system and how parents can help their children benefit via progressive learning methods like Problem based learning (PBL) here: https://vega.edu.in/what-is-the-correlation-between-exams-and-success-in-life/With the pace of change accelerating in the 21stcentury, a key requirement to thrive is lifelong learning and the ability to acquire new skills quickly. To enable ‘learning to learn’ and to be able to continually reinvent oneself is possible only if it’s fostered in children from a young age. This can occur only if it is widely recognized by educators, policy makers and parents alike. Parents of today can help prepare their children to succeed in the future world if they enable them to embrace and learn real world skills by enrolling their children in institutions that use progressive teaching methods and innovative learning approaches to make them excel in life - both personally and professionally. Dr. Steven Edwards, a former advisor to the Whitehouse, United Nations and one of the Co-founders of Vega Schools, Gurugram says, “The Problem Based learning methodology at Vega is designed to enable our learners to develop the mindset, skill-set and values to navigate a rapidly changing world. Schools need to teach things that will lead to real world success. We believe in the 40-40-40 rule. Our learners must not only learn for the next 40 days, their academic understanding should be such that they can apply what they’ve learnt over the next 40 weeks and 40 years.”Embracing these changes in the current education system will be challenging and time-taking for a majority of schools in the country.Vega Schools has already garnered many accolades and had recently won the ‘Top Education Brands Awards 2020’ in the ‘Innovative Schools in India’ and as one of the “Top 5 schools in Gurgaon” category that was presided by a jury of eminent leaders from the education domain namely - Dr. R. Ramanan (Mission Director, of the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) & Additional Secretary at NITI Aayog), Dr. Manish Kumar (MD & CEO, National Skill Development Corporation), Lata Vaidyanathan (Director of TERI Prakriti and former Principal, Modern School-Delhi), Dr. Pankaj Mittal (Secretary General, Association of Indian Universities (AIU) to name a few.Vega Schools Leadership board comprises highly qualified and experienced educators and diverse leaders from all walks of life. Besides Gowri Ishwaran, the board includes the likes of Rajan Hooda (formerly McKinsey), David Price (OBE), Lene Jensby Lange (Danish designer of learning), Sunil Radhakrishna (Formerly DCM Shriram Group) & Dr Rajat Chauhan (former Director of Sports, Ashoka University).Given the success of the PBL methodology and pedagogy at their first school campus in Gurugram, Vega Schools, which is now considered as one of the best schools in Gurgaon, is also launching a second school campus. The new K-12 campus that is coming up in Gurugram, will also become India’s first CBSE school that shall have classrooms with moving walls and which will be completely aligned with the NEP 2020 requirements.To know about Vega Schools, Gurgaon, and the NEP-aligned pedagogy of (PBL) Problem based learning; you can visit www.vega.edu.in or call +91-9899330955.Disclaimer: This content is distributed by Business Wire India.

The former Trump administration had denied India a waiver from a 2017 U.S. law aimed at deterring nations from buying Russian military hardware, a stance that is expected to continue under President Joe Biden.“We reiterated our commitment to military-technical cooperation,” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said after discussions with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. “We have an intergovernmental commission on military-technical cooperation. It has its plans, and this includes discussion of additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment on Indian territory.”Jaishankar said the S-400s would be discussed at a meeting of defense ministers later in the year.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced a weekend lockdown and night curfew during the weekdays from Monday to April 30, besides other measures to curb the spread of infection. As per Union health secretary Rajeh Bhushan, Mumbai is among the 10 districts in the country with the highest number of new Covid-19 cases while Maharashtra is among states of maximum concern.Thackeray said that during the previous lockdown, when there was a massive outflow of migrants to their native states, he had suggested they be registered and tested on their return to Maharashtra.“Both my suggestions were ignored. Today it’s Corona, tomorrow it could be some other virus. This chain is not going to stop,” he added.For over a decade, Thackeray is known for his tough stance on migrants, blaming them for eating up the employment opportunities of the local Maharashtrians. This paid him rich dividends in the 2009 assembly polls but then MNS’s performance slid massively during the 2014 and 2019 polls.Also read: Maharashtra BJP chief says one more MVA minister will resign in 8 daysFormer Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said Thackeray should stop indulging in such parochial politics. “In this time of the pandemic, Raj Thackeray should understand the gravity of the situation and not indulge in such cheap gimmicks,” said Nirupam.Thackeray, during his media interaction, also gave details of his zoom meeting with his cousin and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He asked the chief minister to allow retail shops to open at least twice a week, penalise hospital that are refusing beds to Covid-19 patients and give relief in case of electricity bills.Thackeray also demanded the cancellation of 10 and 12 standard exams and promotion of all these students to the next class.

              " ' European medicine agency says AZ Covid vaccine, rare blood clots in brain linked  There is a link between AstraZeneca\\'s COVID-19 vaccine and very rare blood clots in the brain but the possible causes are still unknown, a senior official for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in an interview published on Tuesday.\"In my opinion we can now say it, it is clear that there is an association with the vaccine. However, we still do not know what causes this reaction,\" Marco Cavaleri, chair of the vaccine evaluation team at the EMA, told Italian daily Il Messaggero when asked about the possible relation between the AstraZeneca shot and cases of brain blood clots.Cavaleri added that the EMA would say there is a link although the regulator would not likely be in a position this week to give an indication regarding the age of individuals to whom the AstraZeneca shot should be given.He did not provide evidence to support his comments.AstraZeneca was not immediately available for comment. It has said previously its studies have found no higher risk of clots because of the vaccine.The regulator has consistently said the benefits outweigh the risks as it investigates 44 reports of an extremely rare brain clotting ailment known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) out of 9.2 million people in the European Economic Area who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.The World Health Organization has also backed the vaccine.The EMA said last week that its review had at present not identified any specific risk factors, such as age, gender or a previous medical history of clotting disorders, for these very rare events. A causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and further analysis is continuing, the agency said.A high proportion among the reported cases affected young and middle-aged women but that did not lead EMA to conclude this cohort was particularly at risk from AstraZeneca\\'s shot.The EMA is expected to give an update of its investigation on Wednesday.Some countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, have suspending the use of the vaccine in younger people while the investigations continue.Scientists are exploring several possibilities that might explain the extremely rare brain blood clots that occurred in individuals in the days and weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.European investigators have put forward one theory that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in some rare cases; others are trying to understand whether the cases are linked with birth control pills.But many scientists say there is no definitive evidence and it is not clear whether or why AstraZeneca\\'s vaccine would cause an issue not shared by other vaccines that target a similar part of the coronavirus.In a separate interview, Armando Genazzani, a member of the EMA\\'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), told La Stampa daily that it was \"plausible\" that the blood clots were correlated to the AstraZeneca vaccine.

After a rollicking start to their season in 2020, Punjab again went off the rails towards the end. They finished the season in sixth position with 6 wins from 14 matches but looked like a side that promised alot but could not deliver.The franchise spent ₹14 crore and 8 crore on Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith respectively during the auctions but their most interesting buy looks like Dawid Malan, who is the top T20 batsman in the world.They decided to rename the side ahead of IPL 2021 as they are now named Punjab Kings instead of Kings XI Punjab.

Young spinner Ravi Bishnoi and Murugan Ashwin punched above their weights last year but a clear cut strike bowler to complement Shami hurt them. ₹14 crore Jhye Richardson was spent during the auctions but it remains to be seen how he performs in pressure situations.

              " ' Bill Gates is reaching for the high-hanging fruit on climate  “Do the Hard Stuff Too” is Point #6 in Chapter 10 of Bill Gates’s new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. Gates elaborated on that point on April 1 in a video talk hosted by the Economic Club of New York. “To get to zero [emissions], you can’t leave the hard categories alone,” the co-founder of Microsoft Corp., now a full-time philanthropist, told the online audience. (He appeared with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.) “We’ve put all the effort into the easy categories of cars and power generation,” Gates said. “In the hard categories, the work has barely, barely begun. You don’t get success unless you cover them all.”“All” is the key point. Businesspeople are accustomed to picking the low-hanging fruit first—knocking off the projects with the lowest costs and highest payoffs before tackling the harder stuff. But that won’t work for climate change, Gates says. To overwork the fruit metaphor, the climate can’t be saved unless all the fruit is picked, including the stuff on the very highest branches. And the effort has to start now.Example: There’s been a lot of progress on solar panels and wind turbines, which is great. Renewable energy has become what Gates calls an “easy” category. But they produce power intermittently, and there’s been far less progress on technologies for storing the energy they produce—not just for a few hours, but potentially for an entire season.The same goes for transportation. Batteries are wonderful for passenger vehicles, but there will never be battery-powered airliners because the batteries would weigh too much and take up too much room. So for the foreseeable future, the net-zero solution for airlines and some other forms of transportation will be alternative liquid fuels that are made from carbon that was already in the atmosphere. While those don’t add to carbon in the atmosphere they are prohibitively expensive and there hasn’t been enough research on bringing down their cost, Gates writes in How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.Other technologies that require research include zero-carbon steel and cement, meat and dairy made from plants or cells, capture of carbon from the air, safer nuclear power plants, nuclear fusion, and coolants that don’t contain fluorinated greenhouse gases, Gates writes. It’s tempting to focus on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But “making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might actually prevent us from ever getting to zero,” Gates writes. An example of that would be replacing power plants that burn coal with power plants that burn natural gas, which is cleaner but still puts out greenhouse gases. A better strategy, Gates writes, is to focus investments on two priorities: installing as much zero-carbon generation as possible, and electrifying as many processes and products as possible in anticipation of the day when all electricity will be carbon-free.“If we think the only thing that matters is reducing emissions by 2030, then this approach would be a failure, since it might deliver only marginal reductions within a decade,” Gates writes. “But we’d be setting ourselves up for long-term success. With every breakthrough in generating, storing, and delivering clean electricity, we would march closer and closer to zero.”In short: Reach for the high-hanging fruit.

Kumar said that there was a possibility of return of migrants from worst-affected states and, as such, officials must set up quarantine centres at block levels on the lines of the ones which were established last year when millions had returned home after losing their jobs and homes during the nationwide lockdown. He also reaffirmed the need for raising testing rate in the state, which had come down to about 20,000 samples per day recently in view of a dip in the incidence during winters, by five times. He pointed out that aggressive testing and isolating, by means of setting up containment zones in the worst-affected zones, along with the ongoing vaccination drive will help the state overcome the sudden rise in coronavirus cases. The chief minister was accompanied by health minister Mangal Pandey and top officials of the state at the meeting here, while District Magistrates were connected through video conferencing. He also called upon the need for strict enforcement of preventive measures like social distancing, wearing of face masks and regular washing of hands. Principal Secretary, Health, Pratyaya Amrit during his presentation in the meeting said that eight districts- Patna,Jehanabad,Gaya, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Siwan and Saran-have maximum number of active cases in the state.

With multi-speed recoveries, a tailored approach is necessary, with policies well-calibrated to the stage of the pandemic, the strength of the economic recovery, and the structural characteristics of individual countries, she said.\"Right now, the emphasis should be on escaping the health crisis by prioritising health care spending, on vaccinations, treatments, and health care infrastructure. Fiscal support should be well targeted to affected households and firms.\"Monetary policy should remain accommodative (where inflation is well behaved), while pro-actively addressing financial stability risks using macroprudential tools,\" she said.Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive, and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output, Gopinath said.\"The priorities should include green infrastructure investment to help mitigate climate change, digital infrastructure investment to boost productive capacity and strengthening social assistance to arrest rising inequality,\" she added.The global economy shrank by 4.3 per cent last year, over two-and-a-half times more than during the global financial crisis of 2009.According to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker, the Covid-19 has so far infected 131,707,267 people and killed 2,859,868 people across the world since it first broke out in central China\\'s Wuhan city in 2019.

              " ' \\'Need for a lockdown\\': Gujarat HC tells state govt amid rising Covid-19 cases  After the High Court of Gujarat on Tuesday asked the state government to consider imposing a curfew for a few days as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation was getting \\'out of control\\', the government decided to impose night curfew and a few other measures effective from Wednesday. The night curfew will be from 8pm to 6am in 20 cities up to April 30. Only 100 people will be permitted in weddings and all political and social functions with more than 50 people have been banned till April 30. Additionally, all government offices will remain shut on Saturdays, the government notice said. Gujarat on Monday recorded over 3,000 fresh cases of the virus.During an online hearing, a bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said a lockdown or curfew for 3 to 4 days is needed to curb the spread of the virus. \"Urgent and serious steps need to be taken to check this. Otherwise, the Covid-19 situation will go out of hand. May be three-four days of curfew or lockdown can be imposed to check the situation at the moment,\" Chief Justice Nath said, according to news agency PTI. All kinds of gatherings, including political functions, should be stopped, he added.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe night curfew imposed from between 9pm and 6am in four major cities of Gujarat was not proving to be effective, according to Chief Justice Nath. On March 31, night curfew in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot was extended till April 15. This was the seventh extension of the night curfew, which first came into force in November 2020, after a spike in Covid-19 cases in these cities after Diwali. \"You can always open it after three-four days of curfew. But, this curfew will help, I think. Like, initially in March 2020, there was a curfew for two days, three days,\" Chief Justice Nath said.Justice Karia said steps needed to be taken to reduce the number of people going to office in order to break the chain of infection. To make sure \"less number of people come in contact\" with each other, he suggested that the government should limit the number of employees coming to offices or commercial establishments.To these suggestions, Advocate General Kamal Trivedi said he will take instructions from the state government and revert, according to PTI. \"Day before yesterday, the government was seriously thinking about imposing a lockdown. But, there were views that a lockdown is likely to cause misery to the poor people,\" the advocate general said, adding that the government is in a \\'Catch-22\\' situation.

              " ' Animal cruelty cases rose in Mumbai since lockdown, claim activists  On March 28, a man was captured on CCTV at Naya Nagar in Goregaon west molesting a stray dog; however, no police case was registered. On March 11, a serial dog rapist was arrested by the DN Nagar police for raping at least eight female dogs only after the video of the crime was submitted to the police. On March 4, a five year old community dog was beaten to death by a few locals at Chandivali, following which, an FIR was registered at the Sakinaka police station under Section 429 (mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless an animal) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) but no arrests were made, in spite of a recorded video of the violent act. On October 20, 2020, a nine year old female dog was raped, brutally injured by pushing a wooden stick in her private part and left to die near Galleria mall at Hiranandani Gardens in Powai. The police registered a case of rape and attempt to murder against an unidentified man who is still at large. These are just a few instances reported to the police where people have acted worse than the animals during the post lockdown period - starting from April 2020. According to animal activists and NGO workers, the number of animal abuse cases has increased drastically and at an alarming rate post lockdown. Vijay Mohnani, of the NGO Bombay Animal Rights and the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA), said the frustration of losing jobs and inflation is also one of the reasons for incidents of animal abuse doubling in 2021 compared to 2019 and 2018. Data collected by the NGOs reveals that in the first two months of 2021, at least 8 animal abuse cases were registered in Mumbai every day, as compared to 3 or 4 cases in 2019. Last year, despite the lockdown, 886 cases were registered, with maximum cases registered after September 2020. Out of the 480 cases recorded in the first two months this year, 266 were accidents and hit and run cases, while the rest were brutal murders, rapes, assaults and harassment like starving the animal or death due to abandonment. “Before the lockdown we used to get around 2 to 3 complaints of hit and run and accident cases of stray animals but after the lockdown these numbers have increased to 7 to 8 cases in a day across the city,” said Mohnani. Police and activists say some men consider it a sport to harm and abuse defenceless animals by beating, kicking, torturing, throwing acid or boiling water, amputating part of the body, attacking with a knife or a blunt object. Lata Parmar, Mumbai unit head of the People For Animals (PFA) said since the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) doesn’t keep animal violence data, it becomes difficult for the government and police to gauge the problem. “This data is collected by the reports that reach us but there are so many cases that go unreported,” said Parmar. BJP Member of Parliament and animal rights activist, Maneka Gandhi, who was also the chairperson of PFA, advocated for stricter punishment and penalties for offenders. Parmar said insensitivity towards animals and ignorance of law are the main causes of animal abuse cases. “Many do not know the law and others do not care as punishment for injuring an animal is rare, which makes them fearless,” said Parmar. Police officers said no separate data on victimised animals was available. From 2010 to 2020 nearly 20,000 cases have been recorded by the police with the help of NGOs and activists but just a few arrests have been made. “We register a case and investigate it and even make arrests,” said Navinchadra Reddy, deputy commissioner of police (zone 10). The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 punishes all kinds of crimes against animals but the fine ranges between just ₹10 to ₹100. Moreover crimes against animals are put on the back burner by the police. “This is proof that crimes against animals are not taken seriously,” said Dr Radha Chaudhary, a veterinary. Increasing cases and lengthy and costly procedures to register a police complaint was taking a toll on the activists now. Mohnani stated that there was just one government run hospital for animals in Mumbai but it was not free and the person who reports the crime is handed over the bill for treatment of the injured or abused animal. Mohnani said that once a rescuer spots an injured animal, he immediately calls the BMC helpline which is not answered. If the rescuer gets hold of an official, he is asked to contact the nearest NGO or a veterinary doctor. The rescuer then has to pay for the ambulance to get the animal to the hospital in Parel or elsewhere. If the animal survives, the rescuer is asked to pay for its treatment or if it dies he has to pay for the last rites. He then has to spend time and money at the police station to register a complaint. “It’s expensive and time consuming, so these days if the animal survives, we avoid filing an FIR due to which many crimes are not registered with the police,” said Mohnani. During the lockdown, activists had to fight with several residential societies to allow pet owners to take them outside for their daily walks, “Animals do not understand lockdown, they need to relieve themselves but many residential societies banned the owners to do so. We had to register many police complaints for harassment to animals,” said Mohnani. WHAT THE LAW SAYSSection 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act makes all animal cruelties a criminal offence. Fines and imprisonment are both provided for. The Indian Penal Code has similar provisions. Under Section 506 of the IPC, it is a crime to threaten, abuse or harass neighbours who feed animals.IPC Section 428 and 429 prescribe severe punishment of up to five years imprisonment to people resorting to dislocation, abduction and acts of cruelty towards community animals or pets and in such cases the police can arrest any offender without a warrant.

              " ' Australia-NZ \\'travel bubble\\' to begin April 19 in pandemic milestone  Though most Australian states have allowed quarantine-free visits from New Zealanders for months, New Zealand has continued mandatory quarantine from its neighbour, citing concern about small Covid-19 outbreaks there.The virus has effectively been eradicated in both countries, with minor outbreaks a result of leakage from quarantined returned travellers. Australia has recorded about 29,400 virus cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, while New Zealand has had just over 2,100 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.\"The Trans-Tasman travel bubble represents a start of a new chapter in our Covid response and recovery, one that people have worked so hard at,\" Ardern told reporters in the New Zealand capital Wellington.\"That makes New Zealand and Australia relatively unique. I know family, friends and significant parts of our economy will welcome it, as I know I certainly do.\"Other neighbouring countries have proposed special travel zones, but the New Zealand-Australia arrangement is among the first that does not involve mandatory Covid-19 testing.About 568,000 New Zealand-born people live in Australia, according to 2018 figures, equivalent to 2.3 per cent of Australia\\'s population and Australia\\'s fourth-largest migrant community.Australia supplied 1.5 million or 40% of arrivals in New Zealand in 2019, the year before the pandemic shut borders, contributing NZ$2.7 billion ($1.9 billion) to its economy, according to New Zealand figures. Arrivals were forecast to reach 80% of that level by early 2022, Ardern said.\"Tourism operators can now take bookings with confidence and scale up their staffing,\" said Chris Roberts, CEO of New Zealand travel industry body Tourism Industry Aotearoa.\\'Flyer beware\\'Flights to and from some Australian states could still be suspended if there were local outbreaks, Ardern warned. She added that travellers must wear masks on flights and undertake New Zealand contact tracing, while the travel bubble did not apply to people transiting via Australia from other countries.The bubble would operate under a \"flyer beware\" system, with no new support from the New Zealand government for people stuck in Australia by cancellations at short notice, Ardern said.Travel would operate state-by-state, and would follow a virus risk traffic-light system, with travel as normal in green light zones, halting for 72 hours in orange zones and halting for an extended period in red-light zones.Air New Zealand Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd said they would ramp up flights between Australia and New Zealand to more than 70% of pre-pandemic levels, reducing the airlines\\' cash burn when they are almost wholly reliant on domestic markets for revenue.\"I\\'ll certainly be digging out my passport for the first time since I joined the airline to head across the ditch to see my family, and I\\'m especially looking forward to meeting some of my grandchildren for the first time,\" said Air New Zealand CEO Greg Foran.The bubble will allow the Trans-Tasman Super Rugby competition involving five teams from each country to proceed over five weeks from May 14.The Wellington Phoenix soccer team New Zealand Warriors rugby league side, which both participate in predominantly Australian leagues, might also be able to host home matches after more than a year of playing their matches in Australia.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

              " ' Bombay HC says ByteDance should deposit $11 million in tax evasion case  An Indian court on Tuesday said China\\'s ByteDance must deposit around $11 million that federal authorities believe the company owes in an alleged case of tax evasion, a setback for the firm which wanted to unblock its bank accounts to pay salaries.An Indian tax intelligence agency in mid-March ordered HSBC and Citibank in Mumbai to freeze accounts of ByteDance India as it probed some of the firm\\'s financial dealings. ByteDance challenged the move in court saying the freeze amounted to harassment and was done illegally.ByteDance has said in court it does not owe the tax government is demanding and does not agree with the tax authority\\'s decision to freeze its accounts.After a government counsel said ByteDance owed the authorities about 790 million rupees ($11 million), the High Court in Mumbai said the company will need to keep that amount blocked in a state-run bank.That amount will be frozen, the two-judge bench said.However, the four blocked bank accounts of ByteDance had just $10 million in funds, according to the company\\'s court filing seen by Reuters.A counsel for the federal tax authority, Jitendra Mishra, said ByteDance can utilize the $10 million for making the court mandated deposit, but cannot use it for any other activity. Effectively, Mishra said, the accounts still remain frozen until the amount is moved to the state-run bank.ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ByteDance in January reduced its Indian workforce after New Delhi maintained a ban on its popular video app TikTok, imposed last year after a border clash between India and China. Beijing has repeatedly criticised India over that ban and those of other Chinese apps.Still, the company has told the court it has a workforce of 1,335, including outsourced personnel, which includes 800 people working in its \"trust and safety\" team that supports activities like content moderation overseas.In the tax probe, which started in July 2020, India\\'s tax authority told ByteDance it had reasons to believe the company suppressed certain transactions and claimed excessive tax credits, Reuters has previously reported.

              " ' Uttarakhand forest minister posts a video fighting forest fire; slammed  Amid the raging forest fire in Uttarakhand which has affected over 1300 hectares of area, state forest and wildlife minister Harak Singh Rawat has drawn flak over a video, in which he and his aide are seen trying to douse a forest fire with what appeared to be a shrub or a stem.The Congress and Aam Aadmi Party said the video and stills shared on social media by the minister’s close aides were “mere publicity stunt”.“When the forest fire was raging, then the forest minister was nowhere to be seen. But now, when the choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) have arrived to fight the situation, he has now come up with a publicity stunt,” said Congress state president Pritam Singh, who earlier said the BJP led state government was “doing nothing” to control the forest fire.“Forests are Uttarakhand’s most precious assets after the Himalayas. And the lethargic response of the minister to such a serious situation shows this government doesn’t care about the forest of our state,” Singh said.Earlier on Monday, two Mi-17 helicopters reached Uttarakhand to help in fighting the forest fires which have so far affected about 1,300 hectares of forest area and claimed four human lives. Currently over 85 forest fires are raging in hill districts. This year since January 1, the state has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents, in which 1540 hectares of forest land has been damaged. Of these 1,130 forest fire incidents, the maximum 269 have been reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 116 in Tehri, 100 in Bageshwar, 94 in Pithoragarh, 93 in Almora, according to the data provided by the state forest department. Since 2000 to April 4 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires.“When the people were sharing videos and photographs of the forest fire incidents on social media, urging the government to take note of the situation urgently, the minister didn’t pay any heed. Now, instead of taking concrete steps to control it and prevent it in future, he decides to come up with this ridiculous video just for publicity,” said Amarjit Singh, spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party in Uttarakhand.Minister Rawat however, couldn’t be contacted for a comment till the filing of the story.

Now that’s f***ed up,” Winslet told The Sunday Times.The Oscar-winning actor, who earned critical-acclaim for playing a lesbian character in period drama Ammonite, currently stars in HBOs miniseries Mare of Easttown in which she plays the role of a small town detective.The Titanic star said she knows a “well-known” actor who just got a new agent, and that agent told the client, “I understand you are bisexual. I wouldn’t publicize that.”“I can think of at least four actors absolutely hiding their sexuality. It’s painful because they fear being found out. And that’s what they say, ‘I don’t want to be found out\\',” she said.The 45-year-old actor believes it is harder for men to come out in Hollywood as they fear not getting good roles.The notion that gay actors can\\'t play straight characters, she said, \"should be almost illegal\".\"You would not believe how widespread it is. And it can’t just be distilled to the question about gay actors playing gay parts. Because actors, in some cases, are choosing not to come out for personal reasons.

              " \" IPL 2021: Chennai Super Kings - Team profile and full squad  Chennai Super Kings have been one of the most consistent sides in the history of Indian Premier League. The three-time champions qualified for the playoffs in every single edition they played in before 2020. However, last season was a disaster for them as they finished seventh in the points table and looked like a side that needed some revamp.MS Dhoni also looked a little rusty last season as he managed just 200 runs in 14 matches. But he has been tasked with overseeing this tough period for CSK. They haven’t gone for a massive overhaul of the squad but have instead kept faith in their resources.CSK decided to spend big on K Gowtham and Moeen Ali at the IPL 2021 auctions while also securing the services of Robin Uthappa. It will be interesting to see how CSK manage their resources while trying to secure their fourth title.Here is the full squad of Chennai Super Kings for IPL 2021: MS Dhoni (Captain), Suresh Raina, Narayan Jagadeesabn, Ruturaj Gaikwad, KM Asif, Karn Sharma, Ambati Rayudu, Deepak Chahar, Faf du Plessis, Shardul Thakur, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, Lungi Ngidi, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Imran Tahir, Robin Uthappa, Moeen Ali, K Gowtham, Cheteshwar Pujara, M.Harisankar Reddy, K.Bhagath Varma, C Hari Nishaanth, R Sai KishoreREAD | IPL 2021: Royal Challengers Bangalore - Team profile and full squadStrengthsGreat Home Record:CSK at the Chepauk are an indomitable force. Even though matches will be played without an audience, MS Dhoni is a master of rallying his troops and knows every corner of the field. They will bank on their great home record again this season. Young BloodThe strength of CSK lies in their young blood. Sam Curran, who played his inaugural season for CSL last year, is expected to be their MVP, especially given the kind of form he is coming off. He can give Dwayne Bravo a run for his money in the line-up. Then there is Ruturaj Gaekwad, who turned out for CSK in just six matches last year, but promises to be in line for a lot more in the coming 14 games. The likes of Shardul Thakur and Mitchell Santner are coming off good match practices. Ravindra Jadeja will return from his injury with a point to prove. And who can forget Cheteshwar Pujara, with an altered stance, hitting them mighty sixes in the nets? A sing of things to come maybe?WeaknessesAge factor and lack of match practiceThat CSK still possess a plethora of players who have not had match practice is a worry for the three-time champions. Remember, Suresh Raina has just played a handful of T20 matches in the lead-up to the tournament and Ambati Rayudu didn't make much noise in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy either. There's no doubting Bravo's utility as a player, but at the age of 37 and with a history of injuries, it remains to be seen that how much value he can add. New recruit Robin Uthappa has expressed his desire to score 1000 runs this year, but his last two seasons have yielded 282 and 196 runs respectively. Dhoni himself hasn't played any cricket since November last year. For a lot of these players, this could be their last shot at redemption and CSK need to be careful not to stack all these veterans at once.READ | IPL 2021: Rajasthan Royals - Team profile and full squadOpportunitiesCSK have the opportunity of a lifetime here to show why they are the most consistent side in the history of IPL. Remember 2018… when CSK returned after a two-year ban to win the trophy that year, and followed it with a runner-up finish the year later? That's what this side is capable of. Last year, CSK were simply not able to take off and by the time they realised who the right players were, the ship had already sailed. Above anything else, IPL 2021 is an opportunity for Dhoni to reclaim the moniker of one of the best batsmen. Let's face it, last season Dhoni endured a personal low, scoring just 200 runs without a single fifty. As it is for Raina. Can the dynamic CSK duo deliver one final hit?ThreatsOne of CSK's biggest strengths, their ability to finish off close matches, was on the wane last season. For years, CSK have comprised of power-packed batsmen, or bowlers who would, more often than not, get the team over the line. But last year, the same proven performers could not take what the youngsters from other teams had to offer. An ageing CSK have struck a bit of a revamp and need to find the right balance before it's too late. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics ipl 2021 chennai super kings ms dhoni + 1 more \",\n",

The bench was informed by public prosecutor Deepak Thakare that the applicants had no locus standi as the woman had sought to withdraw her petitions and the applications were filed with political interest.

Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, representing the woman, submitted that the woman should not be forced to continue with the petition and she had no connection to the intervenors, and they seemed to be backed by a political party.

In its order, the court noted that the woman appeared before the bench in the chamber and was identified by her advocate. The court also noted that ???she desires to withdraw the writ petition and she does not wish to pursue the allegations made in the plea and the statement was made voluntarily, without any pressure from either of parties.???

              " \" Ricky Ponting reveals Steve Smith’s batting position in IPL 2021  Steve Smith’s addition to Delhi Capitals for IPL 2021 has undoubtedly provided a big boost to the team. However, with all-rounder Marcus Stoinis and South Africa pace duo Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje being in a rich vein of form, the Australian batsman will likely have to battle it out for the one overseas spot in the tournament.Meanwhile, former Australian captain and Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting has confirmed that Smith will bat in the top three if the latter finds a spot in the playing XI. In a conversation with cricket.com.au, Ponting said that if Smith will have a ‘great year’ for DC if he gets an opportunity.“I think the fact that he's been released from the franchise that he's been at for a long time will make him a bit hungry as well this year. So, if he gets an opportunity with us -- I think it will be in the top three somewhere -- if he gets an opportunity, I'm sure he'll have a great year for us,” cricket.com.au quoted Ponting as saying.ALSO READ | Pant looking to ‘do something different’ in first game against Dhoni's CSK“I caught up with him (recently), he’s very, very keen to go out there and perform well. Obviously, the other side of that is there's a big auction again next year, so if he happens to have a really good IPL this year, then I'm sure that that price is going to go up for the coming season,” he added.The DC head coach feels the mere presence of Smith in the Delhi Capitals camp is enough for the side, considering the knowledge the star batsman has of cricket.“(It's) great to have him as a part of our squad. As I said -- even if he doesn't play, for instance, to have someone like that around with his sort of knowledge on the game and the T20 game, will be great for our group. I can't wait to work with him again,” said Ponting.ALSO READ | 'I believe Quinton de Kock was too smart': Kaneria says no ICC rules were broken during Fakhar Zaman run-outRishabh Pant-led Delhi Capitals will begin their campaign against MS Dhoni’s Chennai Super Kings on Saturday at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium.

              " ' Rana Daggubati on married life: Finally, I feel old and settled  Year 2020 has been quite a difficult one for many, but for Rana Daggubati, it has been a bit different and rather special as he tied the knot with Miheeka Bajaj. Talking about his life as a newly married man, the actor says, “Married life is treating me good. I finally I feel old and settled, and so I am happy.”While it has been a good period for him personally, he does agree that the pandemic has been quite challenging for everyone, especially the entertainment industry. But there’s also some good that has come out of this phase, he notes.“A lot of things are in reset mode. The amount of content people watch has probably increased tenfold. There’s a consistent need to watch new things — content which inspires you and entertains you. That’s where the industry will be headed towards. Today it’s no longer about mediums so much but more about the quality of content. It’s about good content,” says Daggubati, who made his Bollywood with Dum Maaro Dum (2011).Further doling out praises on the OTT platforms, the actor-producer says that it has been quite a boon as it has increased the shelf life of films.“Today, run of the film, whether it’s in theatre or not, it is longer because of the OTT platforms. On the web, the life of a film is forever. Every time my first film comes on an OTT, people watch and still comment on it. Even though it’s 10 years old, it stays relevant even now. OTTs make it like a forever experience,” the 36-year-old shares.The actor is also happy that the Tamil and Telugu versions of his new film, Haathi Mere Saathi have hit theatres, while the Hindi version of the film is on hold because of the spike on Covid cases in the country.“I’m extremely happy about it that people will watch it. It took us really long to get it done, far longer than my others films,” he adds. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that one more minister from the state government will resign in the next eight days.Speaking in Pune on the occasion of the BJP’s 41st foundation day, Patil said that there are at least seven ministers with criminal records in the MVA government. He said that the ministers’ offences are very serious in nature and claimed that the state government will fall on its own.“There are 6-7 ministers in the state cabinet who are facing serious criminal charges. One of the ministers is facing imprisonment for beating up a policeman, while another has recently revealed his relationship outside wedlock. One of the ministers’ son-in-law is in jail in connection with a drug case, while another is facing charges of beating a party worker. We are not interested in taking the resignation of any minister, but it is going to happen naturally. Like in cricket, the first few wickets bat for a longer time, but the tail-enders fall quickly. Similarly, the next resignations from MVA ministers will come at shorter intervals,” he said.Also Read | Patil starts stint as Maharashtra home minister with a promise and appeal in SCPatil said that while the list of wrongdoings of some ministers from the MVA government has already been in the public domain, a few more names will be added to it in the next few days. “The MVA government will collapse under its own deeds. There is no need to put in special efforts to topple it. The BJP will fight the elections on its own and form the government without joining hands with any other party,” Patil said.On Monday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that a few more names will come to light for their involvement in the “extortion” case during the CBI investigation. “There are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation of the case. The alleged involvement of the home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavyweights from the ruling parties are involved in the entire case of ‘extortion’,” he said.According to the BJP leaders, the state unit has decided to go become more aggressive against the MVA government over issues such as corruption and lockdown.

              " ' Post Quad summit, India-China military talks on LAC friction possible on April 9  The 11th round of India-China military dialogue may take place on April 9 to resolve the friction at Gogra-Hot Springs and restoring the pre-April 2020 status quo ante along the 1,597-kilometre Line of Actual Control(LAC) in East Ladakh, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The Indian army also wants to resolve long-standing patrolling issues at Depsang Bulge due to friction in the area during the 2013 stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“The dialogue will most probably take place on Friday (April 9) but a confirmation is still awaited from the PLA side,” said a senior official. He, however, insisted that there is no delay from the Chinese side.While the situation on both banks of Pangong Tso is stable with the PLA and Indian Army going back to pre-April 2020 positions, a score of Chinese soldiers is still to restore status quo ante in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, or patrolling points 15 and 17 as per the Indian military lexicon.Also Read: ‘Build on Pangong Lake drawdown, disengage at other points’: India tells ChinaThe last round of military talks to resolve border tensions that began last May was held on February 20. This meeting stretched for 16 hours and ended with two sides agreeing that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided them with a “good basis” to resolve the outstanding issues at friction points in “a steady and orderly” manner.Indian Army commanders believe that the differences between the two sides at the Gogra-Hot Springs area was relatively a minor issue as compared to the diversion of views on the strategic heights on both banks Pangong Tso. But there is recognition that the talks could go either way though the army has approached the dialogue with an open mind.The 11th round of military talks comes at a time there is growing concern in China about the Quad security dialogue and the attempts to raise pressure on Beijing to loosen its hold over Taiwan and the South China Sea.Leaders of the four-member Quad grouping - the United States, India, Japan and Australia - held their first summit on March 12 to address concerns about Beijing’s growing economic and military heft. A meeting of US-China officials at Anchorage on March 18 also ended acrimoniously, making it clear that there was no possibility of a revival in US-China bilateral ties in a hurry despite the change in the White House.To add to China’s concern is the concerted effort by powers such as France and the United Kingdom to expand their footprint in the Indo-Pacific and India playing a pivotal role in the region, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Navies of France-plus Quad countries are already in the middle of exercises in the Bay of Bengal. with French carrier strike force led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will participate in the trilateral naval exercise along with the Indian and the United Arab Emirates navies in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman later this month.Officials suggest it is not clear these developments would impact the military talks. With both the US and China accusing each other of grand-standing at the Anchorage meeting last month, the PLA may either harden its stance or soften its attitude towards the resolution of Gogra-Hot Springs. The Indian Army, which has been long prepared for a long haul at the friction points, is also keeping a close watch on the entire 3488 km LAC as most stand-offs with PLA take place in April and May during exercises in Tibet and Xinjiang by the Western Theatre Command based in Chengdu.

Warnings were given that the situation should not be taken for granted,\" Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member said at a press conference.Dr Paul confirmed that the situation has worsened and the speed of increasing Covid-19 cases is higher than last time.\"We have suggested state governments increase the percentage of RT-PCR tests, which is reducing in Maharashtra in the last few weeks. Only 60% of total tests were done through RT-PCR method in Maharashtra last week. We suggest states take it to 70% or above,\" Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a weekly press briefing.According to the officials, the deteriorating situation in Chhattisgarh has sent the alarm bells ringing as the state has become an area of \"concern\".\"Chhattisgarh is a cause of concern for us. Despite being a small state, it reports 6% of total Covid-19 cases and 3% of total deaths in the country. The condition of Chhattisgarh has deteriorated in the second wave of infections,\" Bhushan said in the press briefing.\"Death numbers being reported in Punjab and Chhattisgarh are cause of extreme concern,\" he added.Maharashtra - India\\'s worst affected state - accounts for 58% of the active cases and 34% of the total deaths, officials said. They added that around 4.5% of deaths due to the virus are being reported in Punjab.\"Compared to Punjab, active cases and death toll are very low in Delhi and Haryana. It is satisfactory that the share of RT-PCR tests in average daily tests has increased to 76% in Punjab,\" Bhushan said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan is scheduled to hold a meeting with health ministers of 11 states and union territories (UTs) to take stock of the situation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also hold a meeting with chief ministers on Thursday to review the Covid-19 situation in the country.

              " ' Suez Canal traffic briefly stopped after oil tanker loses power  Ship traffic through Egypt’s Suez Canal was briefly halted again Tuesday just two weeks after a giant container ship wedged itself across the waterway and blocked it.The oil tanker Rumford needed tug boat assistance but was soon operational and the northbound convoy was moving normally again, according to an email from Inchcape Shipping Services.On March 23, a 400-meter long container ship, the Ever Given, ran aground and became stuck. It took almost a week to dislodge it and get it under tow.That incident caused a hundreds-long traffic jam of ships. Tuesday’s disruption serves as a reminder that traffic through the waterway is vulnerable to things outside the control of the Egyptian authorities.About 12% of trade passes through the Suez Canal, a waterway shaving thousands of miles off voyages from Asia to Europe.

              " ' Polling in Tamil Nadu proceeds smoothly, sporadic violence in Kerala  Sporadic incidents of violence marred elections in Kerala while polling in neighbouring Tamil Nadu was underway smoothly even as Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) chief Kamal Haasan alleged money distribution in Coimbatore and filed a complaint with the local returning officer. Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry are being held in a single phase on Tuesday. The polling coincides with the third and the last phase of balloting in Assam. The third of the eight-phase elections in West Bengal is also being held on Tuesday. Nearly 100 million voters were eligible to vote on Tuesday to elect 475 assembly members across four states and the Union territory of Puducherry. It is the biggest election day since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The results of the assembly elections will be announced on May 2.Mohammed Ashraf Kalathil, a presiding officer in Payyanur constituency in Kerala’s Kannur, was hospitalised after ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), activists allegedly attacked him for preventing a man from voting without an identity document. The voting was stopped for half an hour and another officer was appointed to replace Kalathil.The ruling party workers also allegedly manhandled Abdul Rasheed, the Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate, from Adoor.Also Read | Tamil Nadu assembly election: Polling proceeds ‘smoothly’ with 40% voter turnout till 1pmA 65-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman waiting to vote in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts collapsed and died in Kerala, where 52.41% turnout was recorded by noon despite the soaring temperatures. The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala seeks to buck the trend of political parties swapping power every five years and return for a historic second consecutive term by beating the UDF. Roughly 27 million people were eligible to vote in the state, where 957 candidates are contesting 140 seats.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed confidence that the LDF would be voted back to power. “I have full faith in the people, who are with the Left,” he said. He added the ruling front would get more seats than it had won in the 2016 assembly polls and register a historical win.Vijayan said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s account in Nemom, the only seat it won in the 2016 polls, will be closed.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance seeks to increase its tally in the state and has named Metro Man E Sreedharan as its chief ministerial candidate. In a month-long campaign, political parties in Kerala clashed on contentious issues including allegations of gold smuggling against some officials in the chief minister’s office and the controversy around the entry of all women into the Sabarimala Temple.Vijayan said the devotees of Lord Ayyappa, Sabarimala presiding deity, and all other gods will be with the LDF.Also Read | LDF will be voted to power for welfare measures, Covid-19 management: KK Shailaja after casting voteCongress leader Ramesh Chennithala said devotees will not forgive the Left Front, which will face the wrath of Lord Ayyappa. Congress leader A K Antony sought Vijayan’s apology.BJP and Hindu organisations protested against the LDF government’s move to implement the 2018 Supreme court verdict allowing women of all age groups to offer prayers at the hill shrine at Sabarimala. Women in the 10-50 age group have traditionally been barred from worshipping there.The by-poll to Malappuram Lok Sabha necessitated by the resignation of P K Kunhalikutty, who is contesting to the state assembly, is also being held. In Tamil Nadu, Haasan, whose party is contesting assembly elections for the first time, said tokens were also being given in Coimbatore to be redeemed for articles and hinted that he may file a complaint on the matter.Chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo said a few Electronic Voting Machine glitches in Tamil Nadu were attended to immediately and that the polling was going on smoothly across the state. “Free and fair polls are on,” he said. Sahoo added there have been no complaints and that observers and zonal parties were monitoring the polling exercise. Sahoo promised immediate action in case of any problem and added no untoward incident has been reported so far.A 53.55% turnout till 3pm was recorded in the state, where over 62 million were eligible to vote.People begun queuing up to vote much before polling began at 7 am with Covid-19 protocols in place. The Covid-19 patients will be allowed to vote in the last hour of the polling in Personal Protection Equipment kits.Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami voted at Siluvampalayam in his native Salem district. “I request (all) to perform our democratic duty,” he told reporters.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M K Stalin paid homage at the mausoleum of his father and late former chief minister M Karunanidhi and the party founder, CN Annadurai, before voting.Tamil Nadu has 88,937 polling stations. As many as 4,17,521 polling and over 15,00,00 security personnel have been deployed to conduct the polls. The EC has declared 10,813 polling stations vulnerable and 537 critical. Webcasting was being done from 50% of the polling stations.Actor Vijay publicist clarified that he cycled to vote because of parking issues after sparking speculation that he did so in view of fuel price rise.The election to the 234-member Tamil Nadu assembly is the first since the death of two stalwarts and former chief ministers, M Karunanidhi (DMK) and J Jayalalithaa of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The DMK-led alliance is looking to unseat the AIADMK government after being out of power for 10 years.Tamil Nadu has a million more women voters than men, even though women representation in candidature is less than 10% for the main political parties. In Puducherry, where around 330 booths were identified as vulnerable, brisk polling was reported since the morning despite soaring temperatures.Over a million voters were eligible to vote for 324 candidates contesting the 30-assembly seats.

              " ' Karnataka govt rules out negotiations with RTC workers, warns against strike  With the employees of road transport corporations set to go on a strike on wage related issues from April 7, the Karnataka government on Tuesday warned of strict action and ruled out any negotiations with them.Noting that most of the demands made by the employees have been addressed despite financial constraints due to Covid-19, the government made it clear that their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report for the Road Transport Corporation workers cannot be fulfilled.The government has also made alternate arrangements by roping in private transport operators aimed at addressing inconvenience caused to the public, due to the strike, officials said.\"Transport employees have given a call to go on strike from tomorrow, the Chief Minister held a discussion in this regard, we are requesting employees not to go on strike keeping Covid-19 situation in mind.They had nine demands, eight of them have been fulfilled and implemented,\" Chief Secretary P Ravi Kumar said.Addressing reporters after meeting with the Chief Minister, he said their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report, and thereby give them the salary on par with the government employees, cannot be accepted.\"It cannot be given to transport employees,\" he said, however, the transport minister after discussion has agreed for an 8 per cent increase in salary as an interim relief, but it cannot be implemented immediately as the model code of conduct is in place and a letter has been sent to the Election Commission seeking permission.Workers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), under the banner of Karnataka State Road Transport Employees League have given a call for strike from April 7.The protest is against the governments failure to implement a salary under the 6th Pay Commission for the RTC workers.Observing that so far pay revision used to take place for transport employees once in four years after discussion with them, Kumar claimed that for government employees pay commission implementation takes place after five or six years, some time 10 years also.Due to Covid-19 situation, lockdown and decline in number of passengers the transport corporations had no proper income and yet the state government ensured payment for staff on time, by spending ₹2,100 crore, he said.Pointing out that the Transport Minister and the Chief Minister have made an appeal, as the strike will cause problems for the public, the Chief Secretary said to address the situation the transport department will take measures.\"Private buses, maxi cabs will be left free, they will be allowed to operate in assigned routes.The Transport Commissioner is working on alternate arrangements across the state,\" he said.But still there will be some inconvenience, also Railways have been requested for special trains to places like Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Hubballi, Mysuru among others.The CM directed us to deal with the transport strike \"strictly\", Kumar in response to a question said.The government is mulling imposing Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA).\"There will be no more negotiations or talks... still if they go for strike, all the measures that can be taken in the framework of law will be taken.This is the strict decision taken by the CM and it will be implemented... no work no pay will any ways be there,\" he said.Warning the employees against damage to buses and public assets in the name of strike, he said such things will be dealt with very seriously.Citing Covid-19 restrictions in place and a notification already issued under the Disaster Management Act stating that people cannot gather in groups, Kumar said if it is violated, action will be taken.Highlighting the situation faced by public transport corporations, he said 45 lakh passengers used to commute in public transport buses in Bengaluru alone per day, which has now reduced to 20 lakh, and may further go down due to COVID.\"Public transport corporations are facing ₹4 crore loss per day, the government is filling in for it,\" he said.Making it clear that action will be initiated against those involved in any kind of instigation, the Chief Secretary said the transport commissioner will take steps to ensure that autos and cabs don\\'t charge exorbitantly, taking advantage of transport strike.The Transport Commissioner said notification fixing cab and bus fares has already been issued and no once can charge over it.\"If we get to know about it, strict action will be taken.\" SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics karnataka covid-19 pandemic rtc strike + 1 more ',\n",
              " ' Why do we pick problematic partners?  Humans crave love ever since birth, love from parents, siblings, friends, and eventually from their partners. Everybody has a certain type of people they feel attracted to and want to be in love with. The types may vary from jolly, kind, introvert, adventurous, and so on. ‘Problematic’ is probably the last trait people are looking for in their partners. Then why do some people choose to suffer from problematic partners but still can’t let go? There is a famous quote by Stephen Chbosky in his novel, the perks of being a wallflower, “We accept the love, we think we deserve.” Do some people think they deserve problematic partners, or they overlook the problems and continue to suffer? Experts tell us why. Psychological History Experts believe, the kind of partner we look for in our adult life is a reflection of the love we received as a kid, the relationship that we witnessed between our parents. The first exposure of those feelings leaves a permanent mark on our vision of love and we try to look for people who can evoke the same feelings, we are comfortable and familiar with. Sometimes these feelings are not pleasant, for instance, if someone grew up around an abusive parent or was abused as a child. They will be okay with an abusive partner, unlike others. If someone grew up with a depressed or aloof parent, they would find themselves attracted to the people who will replicate the same set of emotions. Self-perception People with a negative perception of selves tend to walk into a problematic relationship. They choose partners in the consonance of their negative view of self. The feeling of not deserving something good and substantial keeps them from looking for a positive partner. It’s hard for some people to take a compliment because their mind is flushed with all the negatives views of self, which is why they feel uncomfortable around people who appreciate them and tries to make them feel good about themselves. Whereas the partner who supports their unenthusiastic self-perception brings them a sense of comfort. Empaths“They will be devastated if I leave them,” is often the idea, empaths resort to while choosing to stay in a problematic relationship. People with extreme empathy cannot bring harm to anyone consciously, they may choose to suffer, which is exactly what happens in toxic relationships if either person is an empath. They start neglecting themselves in order to protect and care for others. Thinking one is not good enough, they take a people-pleasing route and go miles to rescue and please people. A toxic partner would keep an empath close and cater to each other’s need of being rescued and rescuing respectively. Catering to each other’s need, a negative person and an empath makes for a perfect match. Fear A drowning person in the sea would grab anything to save themselves, likewise, a person drowning in the fear of being left alone or the fear of not being good enough makes them choose a problematic partner. But why can’t they get out of the relationship even after suffering? Experts say that staying in a dysfunctional relationship over a period of time takes a toll on one’s self-confidence, self-image, and ability to be fully themselves. The increase in anxiety and stress is astronomical under such situations. Even if people try to come out of a toxic relationship, the undesirable thought of not finding someone makes people suffer and continue with the relationship. How can you come out of this cycle? Your relationship with others is a reflection of your relationship with yourselves. Growing up in an uninformed environment makes it difficult to understand the patterns of toxicity. The first step towards improving your judgment is to become self-aware. Being aware of your needs and wants in relationships and otherwise. In order to cultivate a healthy relationship with others, it’s imperative to nurture a healthy relationship with ourselves. One has to stop living in denial, denial of their pain and suffering, addressing the problem is the first step towards a solution.(Inputs from Pulkit Sharma, Clinical Psychologist, and Shaira Chaudhry, Wellness Facilitator) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Civic Sanskriti: Life on a finite planet  We are entering the 50th year since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm, which was the first global conference to make the environment a major issue. It was also in 1972, that a group of young researchers at MIT, USA, presented their report called “Limits to Growth”, with the key message that unlimited economic growth on a finite planet is impossible. Over the last few decades, questions have been asked in relation to that message, and especially with greater understanding of climate change and globalisation: who is growing - is it transnational corporations? What does “growth” mean – is it the well-being of people, or do we mean GDP growth, even counting pollution clean-up as growth? What is the impact of economic growth on people and the environment – does it lead to a better life for all, or profits for some and poverty for many?Economic growth, especially in the last 50 years, has certainly led to increasing carbon emissions, and the prospect of dangerous climate change. We only have about a decade to get our act right.While India seems on track with renewable energy targets, the new discussion is: can India set itself more ambitious targets of carbon emission reduction?While the average carbon footprint per person in India is not high, globally, we still have the third largest collective footprint as a country. Growth in food, education, healthcare, infrastructure, has led to many gains over the past few decades. But, now we need to check our growing carbon footprint.The Climate Collective Pune (https://www.climatecollectivepune.org/) formed by a few like-minded individuals in 2018 has been deliberating upon the idea of carbon neutrality.Suggestions submitted to the environment minister include: very large increases in distributed solar power, including rooftop systems for domestic use; improving energy management and doing away with diesel gen-sets; complete (or maximal) shift to electric vehicles; and extensive ecological restoration and greening to sequester carbon.The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, has provisions for how to make buildings more energy efficient. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have already adopted it. MEDA and the Urban Development Department have key roles to play. Since electric cars and bikes are still cars and bikes, occupying road space and using energy currently still generated from dirty coal, we do need to change the way we travel. Reducing private motorised modes will improve road safety, make more efficient use of road infrastructure, and make active travel realistic and safer for those who do choose to walk and cycle. Last week, Climate Collective Pune launched Eco Fusion, an e-magazine to reach out to Punekars with ideas for becoming more environmentally responsible and climate resilient. In his article, Dr Chirag Dhara, a scientist with IITM, Pune, suggests that we must go beyond renewables and electric vehicles.We need a close look at growth and consumption such as private vehicles, fashion, junk food, fuelled by planned obsolescence and advertising leading to “manufacturing of desires”! These cause extravagant use of fossil fuels, minerals, fresh water which are in limited supply. Chirag suggests that we must engage with the idea of “de-growth”, and aim for a conscious change from profligate consumption.Ashish Kothari, a founder member of Kalpavriksh, suggests we should go further than de-growth, which is an idea emerging in the developed world. We need to listen to “ecological democracy” voices emerging in the grassroots movements in India.The key ideas of ecological democracy pertain to living within ecological limits, as well as with equity. There is no single right answer, but communities may evolve their own local solutions in a convivial way, fostering social justice using direct democracy methods. This itself can make life more meaningful.Alternatives Forum, or Vikalp Sangam (https://vikalpsangam.org/) has been documenting many such inspirational grassroots movements from across India.What is ecological democracy in the urban context, and in the urban-rural-regional context? Could urban movements engage more consciously with and benefit from the ideas of ecological democracy? Is it possible to start at a neighbourhood - or city-scale in Pune?The pandemic has increased economic recession and large-scale distress among urban poor and informal economies. How can we “decarbonise” as well as make life better, especially for the poor?These are among the most important conversations we must have. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Leopard rescued from 40-ft-deep well in Pune district  Mumbai: A male leopard who had fallen into a 40-feet-deep well in Junnar taluka (Pune district) was rescued from drowning after a two-hour-long operation on Monday by non-profit conservation group Wildlife SOS, along with the Maharashtra forest department.Residents in Vadgaon Kandali village alerted the forest department about the incident on Monday, after hearing the animal’s distressed cries. A four-member team of rescuers was immediately dispatched to the spot. The animal was brought to safety after rescuers lowered a trap cage into the well. Those involved in the effort said that the animal, who was struggling to stay afloat in the well, sensed that this was its only chance of survival.After being lifted out of the well, the leopard was transferred to Wildlife SOS’s Leopard Rescue Centre for medical examination. Officials estimated the animal to be about five-year-old, and said that he will be kept under observation at the rescue and rehabilitation centre in Junnar for a few days. The resued leopard was transferred to Wildlife SOS’s Leopard Rescue Centre for medical examination. (WILDLIFE SOS) Dr Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “While the leopard was struggling to claw its way out of the well, he sustained minor abrasions at the nail region. We will keep the leopard under observation while he recuperates from this stressful ordeal.”Kartick Satyanarayan of Wildlife SOS, said, “The entire exercise had to be executed quickly and with painstaking care. We are grateful to the forest department for making the rescue a success. The startling increasing rate of habitat encroachment has resulted in decreasing prey base, territory and water sources for predator species like leopards that are then forced to come out into human habitation. Since these elusive cats usually prefer to move around at night, it is common for them to fall victim to uncovered wells.”Yogesh Ghodke, regional forest officer, said, “We suspect that the leopard had fallen into the well at night while on the prowl for food. The leopard is currently under temporary observation at the Wildlife SOS centre.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Besides these, we have to take other measures also to control the pandemic. So, I am sitting here for a moral request to make these things a part of people\\'s habit,\" Chouhan told reporters.He said it is a \"crime\" if someone is not wearing a mask, because this also affects the health of others around that person.Chouhan said he launched an awareness campaign for wearing masks on Monday.\"I ensured that me and my family wear masks...the word \\'mask\\' means \\'mera aapka suraksha kavach\\' (my and your safety shield),\" he said.The coronavirus cannot be controlled only by government\\'s efforts, because the infection is being spread by (inappropriate) social behaviour, he said.\"We are making efforts to arrange facilities to fight the pandemic at the government level, but the infection spread has to be stopped by (appropriate) social behaviour,\" he said.Chouhan said people became complacent when the viral infection was brought under control in the country a few months back due to efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and launch of the vaccination drive.\"This has again caused the spread. Lockdown is an easy solution, but I don\\'t consider it right. A limited lockdown is ok, but a permanent one is not a solution,\" he said.The CM said self-discipline is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection, and urged people to wear masks, maintain social distance, wash hands and adopt other precautionary measures.Chouhan said his office will function during his 24- hour sit-in campaign.\"I will review the Covid-19 situation in the state, talk to leaders of various sections of society and religious leaders on awareness about the disease and also hold a cabinet meeting, besides other works, during this Swasthya Agrah,\" the chief minister said.Chouhan also said he has urged his party (BJP) workers not to come to the venue of his campaign so as to maintain social distance.The state government is also making efforts to take the help of volunteers, who can register themselves for assistance in the vaccination process, spread awareness about the prevention norms, and help patients in home and institutional quarantine, he said.

Paying salaries under the sixth pay commission for transport employees is just not possible,” Kumar told reporters after a meeting with chief minister BS Yediyurappa in Bengaluru on Tuesday.The statements come a day before employees of the four transport corporations, including the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), that provide intra-city bus services within India’s IT capital, have threatened to go on a strike from Wednesday.Kumar said that the government has written to the Election Commission (EC) to approve its proposal to give an 8% hike in wages since there was a code of conduct in effect due to the upcoming bypolls on April 17.He said that there were attempts made by the government to convince the workers to give up on their idea of a strike due to the Covid-19 situation. Kumar said that the government has fulfilled eight out of the nine demands made by the workers.Also read: Yediyuappa welcomes new age firms in Karnataka, assures support to TritonKumar said that workers have been given a raise every 4 years as against 5-6 or even once in 10 years for their counterparts in the government.The government also said that it paid salaries to all transport workers, amounting to ₹2100 crore, despite a drop in collections due to Covid-19-induced lockdown and hesitancy by commuters to use public services.Kumar said that transport corporations were incurring losses worth ₹4 crore per day but the government had assured them salaries irrespective. He added that the transport department has been working on a plan to allow private bus service providers within the city and outside to cater to the demand if the workers go ahead with the strike.Meanwhile, the workers union are yet to decide on their next move.Vijay Bhaskar, a member of the transport workers union, said that the difference between government employees and agitating workers is almost 19% and the 8% increase was also taken without any consultation with those striking.Kumar has warned workers of stern action if anyone resorts to violence or damaging of public property.

              " ' Haryana BJP MP Nayab Saini’s SUV blocked by farmers, windshield broken  Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) parliamentarian from Haryana, Nayab Saini’s car was surrounded by a group of farmers protesting against the three central farm laws during his visit to Shahbad town in Kurukshetra district on Tuesday. The MP’s car was escorted out after its rear windshield was broken by some miscreant in the protesting crowd. The MP was unharmed in the incident, said officials.Shahbad DSP Atma Ram said police personnel managed to clear the way for the MP’s vehicle and added that an investigation was going on in the incident, following which action will be taken. Earlier, farmers associated with the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Charuni), showed black flags to Saini and blocked his SUV. The security personnel faced difficulty in clearing the way blocked by the agitating farmers.BKU (Charuni) and other farmers’ groups have been protesting against the Haryana government’s support for the three central farm reform laws, passed by Parliament last year, alleging it took away the guarantee of minimum support price for their produce and left them vulnerable to the big corporate houses. The government says the laws were necessary to increase farmers’ income and invite private investment to develop the farming sector’s full potential in the country. The unconvinced farmers’ groups have been demanding the repeal of the laws and protesting against the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) and the BJP government in the state.On Tuesday, the BKU was initially protesting outside the residence of Shahabad’s JJP MLA Ram Karan’s residence before they changed tact to surround the house of a local BJP worker, who was being paid a visit by the Kurukshetra MP. They blocked the way of the MP’s vehicle and raised slogans against the BJP-led central and state governments. The farmers were removed by police personnel only after an hour-long drama.

              " \" IPL 2021: Sunrisers Hyderabad - Team profile and full squad  Sunrisers Hyderabad are hard working unit, who produce consistent results despite not having too many match-winners in their team. The duo of David Warner and Kane Williamson have taken turns to guide the team to the IPL final in 2018 and 2018 respectively, with SRH winning the title in 2016.They made it to the play-offs last season too and depend primarily on David Warner and Jonny Bairstow's excellence at the top of the order to produce the runs. With the ball, the team has a big match-winner in Rashid Khan while Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been a consistent force for the team.It's a team that can never be ruled out and that is why they remain one of the favourites for the title again.Here is the full squad of Sunrisers Hyderabad for IPL 2021: David Warner (Captain), Kane Williamson, Jonny Bairstow (WK), Manish Pandey, Sreevats Goswami (WK), Wriddhiman Saha (WK), Kedar Jadhav, Priyam Garg, Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma, Abdul Samad, Virat Singh, Mitchell Marsh, Jason Holder, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Shahbaz Nadeem, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T.

The Afghan trio of Rashid, Nabi and Mujeeb have tons of experience of T20 cricket across the globe. Holder offers great skill set both with bat and balls. Similarly, Bairstow- Warner and Williamson have proven performer in IPL in the past.WeaknessInexperienced middle orderWith the onus lying on the shoulder of overseas batter like Bairstow, Warner and Williamson, SRH ‘smiddle order have failed terrible in last season. As a result, we have also seen Warner playing in themiddle order in few matches’ last season.

Considering the injuries Marsh has failed to bowl continuous spells in recent times and only genuine pacer they have is Holder. They lack a specialist pacer who can bowl 140 clicks or bowls in the death overs, which makes SRH a bowling unit which relies on medium pace and spin dependent attack.OpportunityHigh time for Indian players to prove their worthVijay Shankar, who was retained by the team, has faded away after a brief stint with the national team.

              " \" IPL 2021: Kolkata Knight Riders - Team profile and full squad  Kolkata Knight Riders' campaign in the last two seasons of the IPL was quite similar. They started off by hitting the right notes but all the tuning seemed to go haywire as the tournament progressed. Their decision to switch captains from Dinesh Karthik to Eoin Morgan mid-way through the tournament last year did not yield the desired result but Morgan is a proven customer and one can hope that he would bounce back strong this year.Barring Morgan, Shakib Al Hasan and Pat Cummins, KKR don’t have anyone who can claim to be a superstar of international cricket currently but in Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Sunil Narine and a young pace attack comprising Prasidh Krishna, Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti, they have a pretty well-balanced side.KKR full squad for IPL 2021: Shubman Gill, Rahul Tripathi, Karun Nair, Eoin Morgan (F), Nitish Rana, Gurkeerat Mann Singh, Tim Seifert (F), Dinesh Karthik, Sheldon Jackson, Andre Russell (F), Shakib Al Hasan (F), Ben Cutting (F), Venkatesh Iyer, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine (F), Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi, Vaibhav Arora, Pat Cummins (F), Lockie Ferguson (F), Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrier, Shivam Mavi, Kamlesh NagarkotiStrengthsThe Spin departmentKKR have two of the most experienced IPL spinners in Sunil Narine and Harbhajan Singh. Then there is Varun Chakravarthy, who has proven his worth last season carrying the load of KKR spin department. Shakib al Hasan is a match-winner on his day. Kuldeep Yadav may have lost some form but on his day, he can be a wicket-taker.Foreign ContingentKKR’s foreign contingent is one of the best if not the best in IPL 2021. Sunil Narine and Andre Russell can win a match on their own. Pat Cummins and Lockie Ferguson have been consistent enough to warrant a place in the starting XI. Shakib was a part of the successful KKR and SRH sides. Tim Seifert and Ben Cutting are one of the best foreign back-ups a team could ask for.WeaknessWicket-keeping optionsBarring Dinesh Karthik there is no recognised Indian wicket keeper in the side. While Sheldon Jackson is a viable option, his batting abilities are pale compared to Dinesh Karthik. Tim Seifert is another option that is available for KKR but being an opening batsman and an overseas player, the entire complexion of the team will have to be changed to accommodate him.OpportunityReplacing Sunil NarineSunil Narine has been mediocre at best in recent years but has won sporadic matches for KKR. If KKR are ready to changing the opening pair to Tripathi and Gill – which they did in the backend of last IPL - Shakib could be the perfect candidate to replace Sunil Narine. If they need a seam bowling option, they have Ben Cutting. His lower order hitting will provide Andre Russell more freedom.Young pace bowlers to shinePrasidh Krishna, Shivam Mavi, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Sandeep Warrier and Vaibhav Arora are some young pacers who will be looking to break into the starting XI for KKR.ThreatsSunil Narine and Andre RussellThe Sunil Narine opening experiment has failed more times than it has succeeded. If KKR continue to stick with Narine opening the innings, it pushes all the players down a position which in turn, hampers the KKR batting line up. Andre Russell is one of the biggest hitters in world cricket right now and KKR’s best death bowler. His inconsistency and fitness will keep KKR management on its toes.Form of the SpinnersThough the spin department is one of KKR’s core strengths, their form may be a cause of worry. Sunil Narine is not as effective after his action came under scrutiny. Varun Chakravarthy would be coming back from an injury, Harbhajan Singh is lacking match practice, Kuldeep Yadav is still struggling to find a place in the T20 set-up. KKR will have to be wary of picking the right spin combination going into the tournament. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics kolkata knight riders ipl 2021 \",\n",
              " ' US court moves extradition hearing of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to June 24  A US court has postponed the in-person extradition hearing of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, from April 22 to June 24.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian in her order on Monday moved the in-person extradition hearing of 59-year-old Rana to India to June 24.The court\\'s order came after a conference between Rana\\'s lawyers and those representing the US Government. During the conference, the two sides agreed to hold the in-person hearing of Rana on June 24 at 1.30 pm local Los Angeles time.Meanwhile, Rana’s attorneys in additional motion opposed his extradition to India.“The government has not identified a single case since the founding of this country in which a person acquitted by an American jury has been extradited to a foreign country for trial on charges resting on the same conduct,” it said in its 17-page new submission on Monday.The US Government has time till April 12 to submit its response, if any. The US Government so far has supported the extradition of Rana to India.Rana\\'s attorney argued that the US government\\'s position boils down to this: the term \"offense\" in the India-US Extradition Treaty means whatever the government needs it to mean.In Article 2, the dual criminality provision, where the government needs the term to have a broad meaning, it refers to underlying conduct. In Article 6, it means \"conduct\" when needed to achieve a plea deal with Headley, and it means \"elements\" when needed to extradite Rana.“The Court should reject this \"heads the government wins, tails Rana loses\" approach. Applying ordinary tools of interpretation, it should hold that the term \"offense\" in Article 6 refers to the underlying conduct, and it should deny extradition,” it argued.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US Government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana\\'s extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.In his previous court submission on February 4, Rana\\'s attorney had argued that Rana\\'s extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.

The 59-year-old Rajput, who played two Tests and four ODIs, headed the CIC of the Mumbai Cricket Association, which comprised former India Test players Raju Kulkarni and Sameer Dighe.\"Request for immediate actions till matter is fairly heard and resolved – 1. To reinstate CIC, which was dissolved on 18th February 2021 till upcoming AGM,\" Rajput wrote in a plea to the MCA Ombudsman, a copy of which is in possession of PTI.Rajput, who is also the current Zimbabwe coach, also requested the appointment of the new CIC as \"invalid\".\"....declare the appointment of new CIC under the Chairmanship of Jatin Paranjpe invalid till next AGM via email dated 20 February 2021, where such appointments are to be made as per MCA constitution .....,\" Rajput further stated in the petition.Rajput was removed by the MCA office-bearers after his CIC was appointed for three years.Instead, the office bearers appointed Jatin Paranjape, Vinod Kambli and Nilesh Kulkarni as new CIC members after the earlier committee was dissolved.It is learnt that Rajput-led committee was dissolved on the pretext of \\'Conflict of Interest\\', a charge that the current Zimbabwe coach has vehemently denied.In the long petition, Rajput has given the entire background of the sequence of events, on how the committee was appointed and then how it was dissolved by the cricket body.It must be mentioned that it was the committee led by Rajput that had appointed Ramesh Powar as the Mumbai head coach despite a large section of office-bearers wanting Amol Mujumdar to be at the helm.Under Powar, Mumbai led by Prithvi Shaw put up a brilliant show to win the Vijay Hazare Trophy, literally crushing all the opposition teams.

              " ' San Francisco school board to vote on school renaming, again  The San Francisco school board is poised to reverse a much-criticized decision to purge 44 schools of names it said were linked to racism, sexism or other injustices, a turnaround aimed at avoiding costly litigation and toning down outrage at what critics denounced as ill-timed activism.Just over two months ago, the city\\'s elected Board of Education voted to strip schools of the names of figures including Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Louis Stevenson and longtime California Sen. Dianne Feinstein.Parents, students and elected officials blasted the board for some of its targets — and its timing. The decision in late January came while all of San Francisco’s public classrooms were closed because of coronavirus restrictions. They still are. Mayor London Breed, among others, called it “offensive and completely unacceptable” for the board to focus on changing school names rather than getting children back into classrooms.Some of the city’s youngest students are expected to begin returning to in-person instruction this month after more than a year of distance learning because of the pandemic. There is no timetable for middle and high school students to return.The renaming effort also was criticized for shoddy research and historical inaccuracies. A renaming advisory committee wrongly accused Paul Revere of seeking to colonize the Penobscot people. It also confused the name of Alamo Elementary School with the Texas battle rather than the Spanish word for “poplar tree.\"Amid the outcry, board president Gabriela Lopez said in February that the process would be paused until all children were back in school. Lopez acknowledged in a statement that mistakes were made in the selection of schools and said that when the board returns to the issue, it will engage historians for a “more deliberative process.”The board is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution to rescind its January decision and revisit the matter after all students have returned full time to in-person learning.Since the renaming vote, the board has faced multiple lawsuits, including one from City Hall and the mayor to pressure the school district and board to reopen classrooms more quickly. Another was filed in March by San Francisco attorney Paul Scott, whose children attend public schools, alleging the school board’s renaming decision violated California’s open meeting law and did not involve the community.San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman issued a ruling calling on the board to do what the lawsuit requests — rescind the vote and dissolve the renaming advisory committee — or show by April 16 why it shouldn’t be compelled to do so.The resolution being considered Tuesday does not address the criticism but denounces the lawsuit, saying it “wishes to avoid the distraction and wasteful expenditure of public funds in frivolous litigation.”In other recent controversies, the school board has been widely criticized for a plan to end merit-based admissions to San Francisco\\'s top public high school, Lowell, and use the same lottery-based system that admits students to other high schools.Tuesday’s meeting also will be the first since the board voted last week to remove one of its members, Alison Collins, from her role as vice president and other titles over her tweets about Asian Americans dating to 2016.In the tweets, Collins said Asian Americans use “white supremacist” thinking to get ahead. She has resisted calls to step down and last week sued the school district and five of her six colleagues, accusing them of violating her free speech rights. She is seeking $87 million in damages.

But, honestly our focus was on competing with China,\" national coach Vijay Sharma told PTI.\"At the end of the day, individual performance is most important and we will give our best in the Asian Championship next week,\" he added.The latest qualifying rankings feature three Chinese weightlifters in the top five. Hou Zhihui (4703.1982) heads the list while reigning world champion and world record holder Jiang Huihua (4667.8878) and Zhang Rong (3837.8294) occupy the second and fifth spots respectively.However, only one of the three Chinese lifters will be able to compete at the Olympics as a nation can send only one athlete per weight category, effectively making Chanu the second best lifter in her category.As things stand, in terms of total weight lifted, only Huihua (212kg), Zhihui (211kg) and Gum (209kg) have lifted more than Chanu (201kg). The other lifters are significantly behind the Indian, the closest being USA\\'s Delacruz Jourdan Elizabeth, whose best effort is 195kg, followed by Indonesia\\'s Aisah Windy Cantika (190kg).Chanu had a disappointing outing at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The diminutive Manipuri had failed to record a legal lift in any of her three attempts in clean & jerk and thus could not get an overall total in women\\'s 48kg.The 26-year-old will next be seen at the Asian Weightlifting Championships to be held at Tashkent in Uzbekistan from April 16 to 25.

              " ' Climate change shrinks marine life richness near equator: Study  During some summers, as the Caribbean water temperatures climb, the luminous coral colonies of gold, green and blue that ring the island nation of Cuba give way to patches of skeletal white.The technicolor streaks of darting tropical fish flash less frequently. The rasping sounds of lobsters go quiet.While Cuba’s marine life has suffered from overfishing and pollution, there is mounting evidence that the warming of waters due to climate change may be taking a large toll as well -- both off the island\\'s coast and globally.Research published Monday finds that the total number of open-water species declined by about half in the 40 years up to 2010 in tropical marine zones worldwide. During that time, sea surface temperatures in the tropics rose nearly 0.2 degree Celsius.\"Climate change is already impacting marine species diversity distribution,\" with changes being more dramatic in the Northern Hemisphere where waters have warmed faster, said study co-author Chhaya Chaudhary, a biogeographer at Goethe University.While numerous factors like overfishing have impacted tropical species, the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found a strong correlation between species decline and rising temperature.Fish species diversity tended to either plateau or decline at or above 20C (68 Fahrenheit), the researchers found.\\'Blink of an eye\\'While past studies have shown that ocean warming is driving some species to migrate to cooler waters, the new study attempts to gauge that impact more broadly -- analyzing data on 48,661 marine species including fish, mollusks, birds and corals since 1955.The number of species attached to the seafloor -- including corals and sponges -- remained somewhat stable in the tropics between the 1970s and 2010, according to the study. Some were also found beyond the tropics, suggesting they had expanded their ranges.In other words, scientists say, species that can move are moving.\"In geological history, this has occurred in the blink of an eye,\" said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research who was not involved with the study. \"To see such changes occurring so rapidly is something quite alarming.\"For fixed species like corals, moving is not an option.\"One of the big questions is ‘Will coral reefs as ecosystems and corals as species be able to move north or south enough fast enough to adjust to a changing climate?’\" Ferse said.Cuba\\'s coralsHaving fleets of fish and other swimmers shift rapidly to more temperate waters could devastate the coral ecosystems they leave behind -- along with any fishing and tourism industries that rely on them.Such changes “can have a really huge impact on some of the most vulnerable human communities around the planet,” said Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University not involved in the study.For Cuba, such an impact could unravel the island nation’s efforts to manage its underwater gardens although its corals have been less stressed by coastal development and pollution than corals elsewhere. They are considered more resilient to ocean warming.\"It\\'s impressive to return to an area that experienced significant bleaching the year before, but looks perfectly healthy a year later,\" said Daniel Whittle, who heads the Caribbean program at the Environmental Defense Fund.Cuba opened its first coral reef nursery four years ago to research which species coped best with warming and eventually to repopulate depleted reefs. The country is also restoring coastal mangroves, which serve as fish nurseries and shelter.Chaudhary and her colleagues plan next to look at which tropical species were in decline or were migrating.

              " ' Jordan bans news outlets from covering royal rift  Jordan banned all news outlets and social media users on Tuesday from publishing any content related to King Abdullah\\'s half-brother Prince Hamza after the latter was accused of plotting to destabilise the country.Prince Hamza pledged allegiance to King Abdullah late on Monday after mediation by the royal family, two days after the military warned him over actions it said were undermining \"security and stability\" in Jordan and placed him under house arrest.In unprecedented public criticism, Hamza, who was the crown prince until King Abdullah removed him from the post in 2004, accused Jordan\\'s leaders of corruption and serving only their own interests.The government says he liaised with people linked to foreign parties in a plot to destabilise Jordan and that he had been under investigation for some time.\"To safeguard the secrecy of the investigations being undertaken by the security services in relation to His Highness Prince Hamza bin Hussain and others, Amman\\'s public prosecutor has decided to ban the publication of everything related to the investigations at this stage,\" the state news agency reported.It said the ban applied to all news outlets as well as social media platforms.Prince Hamza said in a voice recording released by Jordan\\'s opposition on Monday that he would not comply after being barred from any activity and told to keep quiet.While not considered a direct threat to the king, Hamza in recent weeks visited tribal gatherings where the king and his government have been criticised more openly.Saudi Arabia was among the countries to issue statements of support to King Abdullah, and on Monday Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan travelled to Amman to meet his Jordanian counterpart Ayman Safadi, the Jordanian foreign ministry said.\"King Salman reaffirmed the kingdom\\'s support to all measures to protect Jordan and its interests,\" Saudi state TV reported.King Abdullah had expressed \"appreciation for the kingdom\\'s continuous support to Jordan,\" it said.

              " \" How to prevent food-borne illnesses  According to a survey done by the Centre of Disease Control & Prevention, it is estimated that each year 48 million people get sick from a foodborne illness, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die.Foodborne illnesses are caused by contamination of food that has occurred at any stage of the food production, delivery and consumption chain. They can happen from various forms of environmental contamination including pollution in water, soil or air. Foodborne illnesses can also occur from unsafe food storage and processing.These diseases borne from food encompass a wide range of illnesses from diarrhoea to cancers. Most of them cause gastrointestinal issues, though they can also produce neurological, gynaecological and immunological symptoms. Diseases that cause diarrhoea are a major problem in all countries of the world and mostly affect children under 5 years of age. Although the foodborne diseases are quite common, it's also important to know the causes of food borne illnesses. The causes fall into the following 3 categories:Biological hazards are the most common cause responsible for food borne illnesses. These include microbes such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Bacteria and viruses are responsible for most of the foodborne illnesses. Biological hazards are the biggest threat and problem to food safety. They can be inherent in the product or can be transferred due to mishandling (e.g., time/temperature abuse).Chemical hazards generally include natural toxins and chemical contaminants. Most of the time there are some natural toxins associated with the food itself that lead to its contamination (i.e., certain mushrooms, PSP in molluscan shellfish) and in some cases the food gets contaminated by pathogens when it is time or temperature abused (i.e., histamine development in certain seafood species). Apart from this, some additives, such as sulphites, can be a hazard for some people.Physical hazards can include metal shavings from cans and plastic pieces or broken glass present in food that lead to its contamination.The symptoms of foodborne illnesses range from mild to severe and depend upon the microbe that has been ingested. However, common symptoms are as follows:Upset StomachVomitingNauseaFeverAbdominal painDiarrhoeaIt might take hours or days to develop symptoms after you consume contaminated food.Foodborne illnesses are quite common and it is important to know the causes and ways to prevent these diseases to keep oneself away from the agony that is caused by these diseases. So, lets know tips for in order to prevent these illnesses:Practice hygiene - Practicing hygiene the first step towards prevention of food borne diseases. One should wash hands before handling food and often during food preparation and after going to the washroom. Washing and sanitizing all surfaces and equipment used for food preparation is imperative. Care should be taken to protect kitchen areas and food from insects, pests and other animals. It is equally important to clean fruits and vegetables well. Using a natural and safer solution like Marico’s Veggie Clean is the best way to do so. This unique, naturally-derived solution will help you get rid of all those pesky germs, bacteria, chemicals and waxes, which tend to go unnoticed on all your fruits and vegetables , rendering them squeaky clean in no time! Simple to use, one is only required to soak and hand rub the fresh produce in a solution made of half capful of Veggie Clean and 1 litre of water followed by rinsing the soaked produce in running water 2-3 times for about 30 seconds.Separate raw and cooked food – It is important to separate raw meat, poultry and seafood from other foods. This can be done by using separate equipment and utensils such as knives and cutting boards for handling raw foods.Storage- Majority times, food contamination occurs at the time of food storage. Care should be taken to store containers separately in different containers to avoid contact between raw and prepared foods.Cooking – Cooking plays a vital role in preventing food borne illnesses. One should cook food thoroughly, especially animal products like meat, poultry, eggs and seafood.Temperature – Keep food at the correct temperature. Make sure to not leave cooked food at room temperature for more than 2 hours. All cooked and perishable foods should be refrigerated promptly (preferably below 5°C).Water- Water plays a very important role to prevent food borne diseases. Make sure to use safe water while washing raw materials and vegetables. Cook food using clean and safe water.Over to youFood borne illnesses are quite prevalent in today’s time. What is important is to maintain hygiene and being aware during the process of food procuring, handling and its storage.Disclaimer: This is a company press release.

              " ' N. Korea to not attend Tokyo Olympics, dashes Seoul\\'s hopes of restarting talks  North Korea will not attend this year\\'s Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic, Pyongyang\\'s sports ministry said, dashing Seoul\\'s hopes of using the Games to restart talks with its nuclear-armed neighbour.The isolated North\\'s participation in the last Winter Games, hosted by the South in Pyeongchang, was a catalyst in the diplomatic rapprochement of 2018.Leader Kim Jong Un\\'s sister Kim Yo Jong attended as his envoy in a blaze of publicity, and the South\\'s President Moon Jae-in seized the opportunity to broker talks between Pyongyang and Washington that led to a series of high-profile meetings between Kim and then US president Donald Trump.But Pyongyang\\'s announcement extinguishes the possibility that the postponed Tokyo Games, due to begin in July, could kick off a reset in the now deadlocked talks process.North Korea\\'s Olympic Committee \"decided not to participate in the 32nd Olympic Games in order to protect players from the world public health crisis caused by Covid-19\", said the Sports in the DPR Korea website, run by the sports ministry in Pyongyang.But analysts said other factors may have been at play.The announcement -- dated Monday -- reported a meeting of the national Olympic committee on March 25.The North\\'s official KCNA news agency had previously carried a dispatch on the committee meeting, without mentioning the Olympic decision.All International Olympic Committee member countries are required to take part in each Games under the Olympic charter.An IOC spokesperson told AFP that it had \"not received any official application from the NOC of DPRK to be released from their obligation\".The spokesperson added that \"despite several requests\" the North\\'s Olympic Committee had been unable to hold a conference call to discuss the coronavirus situation.Border lockdownPyongyang is more isolated than ever after imposing a strict border closure more than a year ago to protect itself from the virus that first emerged in neighbouring China.While the North insists it has had no coronavirus cases -- although experts doubt the assertion -- the lockdown has exacerbated the economic pain from multiple international sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.The new US administration of Joe Biden is in the final stages of a review of North Korea policy, with officials widely expected to support a resumption of lower-level talks rather than high-stakes, high-drama summits.On the campaign trail, Biden characterised Kim as a \"thug\" and has sharply criticised Trump\\'s meetings, saying he legitimised one of the world\\'s most ruthless leaders, but has also said he is open to diplomacy.Biden recently warned North Korea of consequences for violations of UN Security Council resolutions after Pyongyang tested what US officials judged to \\'Shameless distortion\\'Inter-Korean relations are also at a standstill, with the North repeatedly saying it has no interest in talking to Seoul, and last year blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border.Even so, Moon in his Independence Day speech on March 1 said: \"This year\\'s Tokyo Olympics could be an opportunity for dialogues between South Korea and Japan, the North and the South, North Korea and Japan, and North Korea and the US.\"The day commemorates mass protests that took place in 1919 across the Korean peninsula against Tokyo\\'s colonial rule.Seoul\\'s unification ministry said it was \"sorry that the Covid situation\" had prevented the Games from serving as \"an opportunity to advance peace on the Korean peninsula\".Japan\\'s chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said it was monitoring the reports and authorities were seeking to improve the environment, \"including infection countermeasures, so that many countries and regions can participate in the Tokyo Games\".Analysts said the virus may not be the only reason behind Pyongyang\\'s decision.\"Pyongyang seems to be protesting against Japan\\'s policies on North Korea, as sensitive issues such as human rights and sanctions have been raised by Tokyo, along with the US,\" Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.The North regularly excoriates Olympic host nation Japan over its brutal 20th-century annexation, with KCNA carrying a report Sunday condemning new Japanese history textbooks as \"persistent and shameless distortion of history\".Tokyo regularly demands resolution of the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North, although Pyongyang insists it has returned all those it seized who are still alive.

              " \" Pradyot Singh Rathore & Shahrukh Pathan launch Spartans Cricket Academy  Corruption has become linked with sports administration in India. A vast majority of India's sports officials were already convicted of corruption, whether it's cricket, hockey, or weightlifting. The lack of infrastructure and restricted access to just a few elements of society has had a negative impact on sports activities and athlete success because infrastructure is needed for training and game organization.We'll talk about a guy who, along with some trainees, has accomplished fantastic job. Our country is grateful to have him as a good example.Pradyot was already working in a bank, and Shahrukh got a proposition for employment also. Pradyot's companion encouraged them to launch a cricket academy since he realizes the amount, they appreciate the game. They went on a land chase to discover an area for the foundation, yet they didn't get the right land. In any case, following a couple of months, he got a little land from a friend.Pradyot Singh and Shahrukh Pathan quit their jobs and launched a cricket academy in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, named Spartans Cricket Academy.Difficult timeThey were cash-strapped. Their family were enraged, and society used to make fun of them. The academy was established in about six months, and you'll be surprised to learn that Pradyot and Shahrukh, along with their trainees, used to work as labourers because they didn't have much money. Some time they use to ate only one samosa a day on several moments, and on a few times, they worked empty stomach. They used to work hard to create a cricket academy so that the children could receive good training and better instruction.Their troubles didn't end when the academy opened! Just six children come to play, and most of them were unable to pay the fees. He and Shahrukh took on all of the children's expenditure (such as shoes and clothing) and now they train more than 150 players.Such trainees were lucky enough to have Pradyot and Shahrukh as their mentors. The trainees realized that their mentors have done so much for them, and it is now their responsibility to repay them with successful performance. Pradyot and Shahrukh used to bring sponsors for the trainees in order for them to obtain help. They took the trainees to a play in Mumbai with any cost, and now they are going to play international in South Africa and Dubai.Stage of joyRavi Bishnoi, the first player from their academy to play for India's under-19 team, was bought for 2 crores from Kings XI Punjab. Bhanu Pania is playing for Baroda, Sahil Bhaskar has won Rajasthan's best cricketer trophy and has been selected for the under-16 bowling camp, Sawai Choudhary and Shoaib Khan are both playing for Rajasthan. Many students performed admirably and reflected well on their coaches and academy.Pradyot and Shahrukh knew that the Rajasthani students had a lot of potential; all they needed was some guidance and encouragement. He and his team merely attempted to provide them with assistance so that they could shine brightly with their talents. These types of coaches are required in India so that gifted trainees can find the right direction to follow with their abilities. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON \",\n",

The force\\'s director general Kuldiep Singh said on Tuesday that they are planning an operation to locate the soldier.\"One of our jawans is still missing. Rumours are that he is under the captivity of the Naxals. Currently, we are verifying the news and planning an operation in context with the jawan,\" Singh told news agency ANI.Also Read: Maoists cross a red line, again | HT EditorialMaoists carried out a \\'U-type\\' ambush on April 3, luring the security personnel into a fatal trap. The operation was led by the commander of battalion number-1 Madvi Hidma, who security forces are looking for since years, according to an official familiar with the developments. “The security personnel were caught unawares and were at a disadvantageous position. The Maoists planned a U-type ambush. At a particular area, there were hills on two sides and when Maoists started firing, the security forces tried to return. The Maoists encircled them,” the official mentioned above said.Watch | Maoists\\' U-shaped ambush; hunt for Madvi Hidma: Chhattisgarh encounter explained Earlier, talking to ANI, CRPF\\'s Singh said what transpired was not a result of an operational failure. “There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure.

Over 25 Maoists were killed in the attack, he claimed, adding that the exact number was yet to be ascertained.Singh also commented on the threat email allegedly received by the CRPF in Mumbai a few days ago, naming Union home minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, and said the email had been forwarded to the agencies concerned. \"We have forwarded the email to the concerned agencies of Maharashtra and the Centre.

              " ' Novovax allows volunteers on placebo to get Covid-19 vaccine in trials  American vaccine developer Novovax said on Monday that it planned to allow participants in its ongoing Covid-19 vaccine trials to receive an additional shot, Reuters reported. This will ensure that those who received placebo doses initially receive the actual vaccine now, and vice-versa. All the participants, however, will continue to be \"blinded\" so they do not know if they received the experimental vaccine or the placebo, the news agency added.A \\'placebo\\' vaccine has no therapeutic value, but can function as a control for vaccine testing, where researchers gauge the efficacy of the actual vaccine dose by observing the \"expected\" physiological response in patients, who have no idea if they treatment they just received was active or inactive. Placebo-controlled studies are thus most commonly used in \"blinded\" clinical trials, where such information about vaccine efficacy is consensually withheld from the participants to illicit an expected response.Even when other authorised vaccines are made available, allowing volunteers on placebo to cross over to the active vaccine offers them an incentive to continue with the trials. Novovax plans to put this incentive to good use, planning to cross over participants in its ongoing large, late-stage study in the United States and Mexico, Reuters reported, adding that Novovax will read out initial clinical data during the second quarter.\"The crossover arms ensure that all participants have access to an active vaccine candidate while allowing Novavax to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of our vaccine over the long term,\" Reuters quoted Filip Dubovsky, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Novavax, as saying. \"We are grateful to the volunteers who stepped forward to take part in our clinical trials, without whom we would be unable to develop, study and ultimately deliver what we hope will be a significant tool in the fight against Covid-19,\" he said.

              " ' Pune residents get first robotic lockers at their complex with Godrej Group  Godrej Security Solutions (GSS), India’s leading home and enterprise security solutions brand, today announced that it is installing India’s first automated vault system, Autovault, at Godrej Elements in Hinjawadi (Pune).Autovault is one of the most advanced and secure multi-locker vault systems based on a robotic platform that blends security and convenience for locker account holders. The locker system provides 24x7 access to the locker to a consumer with complete privacy and the highest level of convenience.It will also offer four-layer security to the consumer by securing access to the designated lockers using a keycard, PIN, and a key. The system restricts entry to anyone in the locker booth once an account holder enters the facility, providing complete safety and privacy during operation.Once the account holder requests to access the locker by swiping the access card and entering the corresponding PIN, the highly accurate and secure robotic system retrieves and brings only the designated locker to the customer. When the customer completes the transaction and locks the locker with the unique safety key, the system reinstates the locker to its designated space in the secured vault.Godrej Element is one of the country’s few residential projects that blends luxury, convenience, and security by offering 21 safety and security features to its residents. Once the installation of Autovault, residents of Godrej Elements will be able to store their valuables, documents, jewellery closer home and offer them secured access 24X7.Commenting on the milestone, Pushkar Gokhale, Head of B2B & Vice President, Godrej Security Solutions, said, “Godrej Security Solutions has always been at the forefront of securing our nation through solutions which are made for India. The pandemic has pushed security, accessibility and convenience upon a consumer’s priority today. Homebuyers have become more vigilant regarding their home, assets, and loved ones’ safety and security and expect holistic security and threat prevention solutions within residential complexes. The automated locker system, Autovault, has already made waves in the BFSI segment. The installation of the Autovault at Godrej Elements further cements the commitment of the two brands to deliver optimum security, convenience and world-class living experience to its consumers.”Commenting on this collaboration, Amandeep Singh, Zonal Head West & East, Godrej Properties, said, “We are excited to partner with Godrej Security Solutions for providing the first of its kind auto vault facility at our project, Godrej Elements in Pune.

              " ' Pandemic, fund crunch halt Delhi parking policy implementation  Haphazardly parked vehicles on roads and often pavements are a common sight in Delhi. Counted among the cities with poor parking facilities globally, Delhi continues to struggle to streamline its parking management despite a policy in place. Almost two years after the government notified the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019, it has been put on the backburner by the three municipal agencies tasked with its implementation. The Covid-19 pandemic, fund crunch, lack of resources, poor enforcement, resistance from market associations have been cited as the reasons for it.Delhi has at least 10 million registered vehicles including 7.9 million two-wheelers and 3.3 million four-wheelers. With 67,50,00 vehicles on an average added to Delhi roads annually, the parking woes continue to grow.As per the policy, civic agencies were to make area-specific Parking Management Area Plans (PMAPs), regulate pricing, identify spaces for overnight parking of commercial vehicles, manage on-street parking and ensure charging facilities for electric vehicles. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) started the implementation of the policy in Lajpat Nagar-III on a pilot basis in January 2020. It prepared a PMAP under which lanes were marked for parking and non-parking purposes. Signage was installed to indicate no parking zones, tow-away zones, one-way lanes, and roundabouts. Vehicles of residents were to be provided green stickers while those of visitors red ones.Also Read | Action on old vehicles, traffic congestion in Delhi’s plan against air pollutionSimilar plans were made for Krishna Nagar in East Delhi and Kamla Nagar in North Delhi and implemented under the supervision of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), which was dissolved in October 2020.Officials cited a lack of funds and manpower due to the Covid-19 pandemic among the reasons for the non-implementation of the policy. The three pilot projects were put on hold due to the nationwide lockdown imposed because of the pandemic in March last year. A majority of the civic staff has been deployed on Covid-19 duties after lockdown norms were eased.Prem Shankar Jha, SDMC’s deputy commissioner, remunerative cell, said even after the lockdown was lifted, the progress on the implementation of the policy remained tardy because of lack of funds and resources. “Before Covid-19, we prepared PMAPs for at least 10 residential as well as market areas such as Malviya Nagar, Greater Kailash-2, Aurobindo Place, Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden among others. PMAPs were to be implemented at these places after the Lajpat Nagar-III pilot project but before we could start work, the pandemic struck and priorities changed.”A North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, who did not want to be named, said their priority is to pay salaries of employees and have no funds to implement the parking policy. “Due to Covid-19, the income of the corporation has drastically gone down. We are unable to pay salaries to the staff and they go on strike every now and then to demand pending salaries. We have a Kamla Nagar pedestrianisation plan ready, but we need resources and money for that. After Karol Bagh and Kamla Nagar, we had to prepare PMAPs in Kirti Nagar and Keshav Puram but that is put on hold for some time.”Anuj Malhotra, a transport expert, said the progress of the project was good until it was being monitored by the EPCA. “There used to be review meetings at regular intervals where civic bodies and other concerned departments used to give status reports on the preparation and implementation of PMAPs. But after EPCA was dissolved in October 2020, there was hardly any monitoring of the project,” said Malhotra, who assisted the civic bodies in formulating and implementing PMAPs for Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said the implementation of the policy is a very complex process and unless there is a continuous, consistent and stringent monitoring mechanism, it is very difficult to push this in the right direction. She said the city needs a strong oversight system and therefore it is needed to be put in place as a mechanism for compliance.“The Supreme Court directive was very clear that the authorities will have to do this city-wide after the implementation of the three pilot projects in Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar. Even in pilot areas, things are now back to square one. So, the big message here is that unless you have continuous and stringent monitoring of the implementation, then even the small progress that we are making will get reversed,” Roychowdhury said. “We have no idea what happened to the progress of parking policy after EPCA was dismantled.”Experts also blamed a lack of proper coordination among agencies involved in the project.Roychowdhury called coordination among agencies a must for the success of any such big project. “There are several stakeholders involved in the implementation of the parking policy. So, that is why you need a strong oversight system for that coordination. A holistic approach is needed.”Malhotra suggested a state-level technical coordination committee for the implementation of parking reforms. “Such a committee should consist of senior urban designers, traffic modelling experts. The committee’s main job should be to coordinate among agencies and to review the PMAPs and provide solutions to tackling an area. It should directly report to the urban development minister or chief minister. The committee shall also coordinate between different departments to help implement the PMAPs.”A lack of a skilled technical workforce is seen as another reason for the lack of implementation of the policy. To address the issue, SDMC in September started training its officials, mostly engineers, on the modalities of PMAPs and how to implement them in neighbourhoods. “We have trained some staff in the three civic bodies to prepare and implement PMAPs, but we still need skilled hands,” said Jha.Malhotra said the municipalities should also hire in-house urban planners and urban designers to create PMAPs to meet the parking requirement of neighbourhoods.Roychowdhury said technical knowledge and skill-building is necessary to create technically sound teams to work on the creation and implementation of PMAPs with the help of professionals. She added the municipalities will have to make PMAPs in large numbers and for that, they need to develop a skilled workforce along with professional guidance.Civic authorities re-implemented the pedestrianisation plan on Karol Bagh’s Ajmal Khan Road on April 1 despite traders’ resistance. The emergency lane of the road, which was taken over by vehicles earlier, has since been reserved for walkers and street vendors. At some points, vehicles continued to be parked on the pedestrianised stretch. “We have reimplemented the plan as per the policy. Traders are opposing the move and we are now assessing the situation. We had invested time and money in making Karol Bagh a pedestrian-friendly market so we cannot let it become a chaotic market,” a municipal official said, requesting anonymity.In June 2020, vehicular movement was allowed on pedestrianised stretches in Krishna Nagar, Karol Bagh, and Kamla Nagar markets on the traders’ demand.Aman Rajput, East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s deputy commissioner, said that vehicular movement on the pedestrianised stretches under their jurisdiction continues as the traders are not supportive of the plan. “They say that their business is already down due to the pandemic and the people coming to markets prefer personal vehicles. So, they say that if the pedestrianisation plan is reimplemented, their business will suffer. We have also put on hold the PMPs for Laxmi Nagar and Geeta Colony as we cannot implement such plans without the public’s support.” SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics ht exclusive ',\n",
              " ' China cautions Japan ahead of Biden-Suga meet, asks to be \\'objective, rational\\'  China’s foreign minister cautioned Japan against teaming up with the US to counter Beijing, as Japan speaks up more on human rights in China\\'s Xinjiang region ahead of a US-Japan summit next week.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart in a phone call Monday evening that their two countries should ensure that their relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said.It quoted Wang as saying that “China hopes that Japan, as an independent country, will look at China’s development in an objective and rational way, instead of being misled by some countries holding biased view against China.”Japan, a close US ally that hosts major American naval and air force bases, shares US concerns about China\\'s military buildup and claims to territory in the South and East China Seas. However, its major trade and investment interests in China have at times reined in its criticism of its larger neighbor.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is to travel to Washington to meet President Joe Biden on April 16 in what will be the US leader’s first in-person summit since taking office in January.Biden, in contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump, has stressed rebuilding ties with European and Asian allies as the US prepares for competition with a rising China.Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi raised human rights in China\\'s Xinjiang region and Hong Kong, both important issues for Biden. He also reiterated Japan\\'s protest against China\\'s presence in waters around a group of uninhabited, Japan-controlled islands that China claims in the East China Sea.Motegi told reporters Tuesday that he expressed “grave concern and strongly requested China to take concrete actions\" for improvement on those issues, including the human rights situation in the Xinjiang region.Some members of a foreign policy team within Suga\\'s conservative ruling party have called for his government to take a tougher stance against China over the Xinjiang situation. They say Japan should adopt a law to impose sanctions against a foreign country over human rights violations.The United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union have adopted such a law, and they say Japan is the only Group of Seven country without it.Japan has taken a softer approach by maintaining dialogue rather than imposing unilateral sanctions. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on Tuesday said Japan is open to the possibility of having such a law.\"It is necessary to analyze and consider whether Japan should adopt a system that would unilaterally determine human rights violations and impose sanctions, taking into consideration various views including our ongoing human rights and foreign policies and trends in the international community,(asterisk) he said.Kato said it is important for each country to do what it can to improve human rights conditions. “Japan will continue to cooperate with the United States and other related countries,” he said.Wang opposed Japanese interference in China’s internal affairs in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the Chinese statement said.Taiwan is another potential flashpoint, with Suga saying earlier this week that Japan would cooperate with the US on the issue. China regards the self-governing island as a renegade province that should be under Chinese rule.China, in a signal to the US and its allies, recently sent an aircraft carrier group to waters near Taiwan for training exercises.

              " ' Covid-19 positivity rate in Delhi above 5%: Why it\\'s a matter of concern?  The Delhi government on Tuesday announced night curfew, which will be in place from 10pm to 5am, to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital. The decision has been taken after continuous rise in the number of cases over the past few weeks.But what has been equally worrying for the government is that the positivity rate - a measure of the number of positive cases from those tested - crossed the five per cent mark. This is the threshold that the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies as ideal for an outbreak to be considered as under control.Also Read: Will eateries be open? Delhi night curfew FAQs answeredWith 3,548 cases after 64,003 tests, Delhi\\'s positivity rate jumped to 5.54% on Monday, which is the highest since December 2 last year.Why is this a matter of concern?The positivity rate determines the spread of the infection, and when it goes above the five per cent threshold, experts sound an alarm saying the disease in on its way to become unmanageable.And doctors agree with that. “We have to keep a close eye on the numbers. The increasing positivity rate indicates that the disease is spreading faster,\" Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Delhi\\'s Safdarjung hospital, said when the fresh spike just began in the national capital in March.“There is a laxity in the Covid-19 norms in Delhi now... This needs to change,” he added.How has Delhi fared in terms of positivity rate?On March 15, 368 cases were reported in Delhi, which showed a positivity rate of 0.6%. This is when Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said the national capital is at a benchmark of Covid-19 cases. \"In Maharashtra, the positivity rate is 16 per cent, Gujarat\\'s positivity rate is three times of Delhi. The positivity rate has reached six times in Punjab, seven times in Kerala and 30 times in Maharashtra,\" Jain said on March 15.Since then, the rate has been on an upward trajectory. In week starting March 22, new cases grew to 888 while the positivity rate inched up to 1.3%.On March 29, the day of Holi, the positivity rate rose to 2.7%. That day, 1,904 cases were recorded.In the week since Holi, the positivity rate rose exactly by double to reach 5.5%.What the Delhi government is doing?\"The case positivity rate was 4.64 per cent on Sunday. Random tests are being done at a fast pace and capacity is being ramped up. More than 80,000 tests are being conducted a day which is five times more than the national average,\" Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain told reporters on Monday.The Kejriwal government is taking a number of other decisions to contain the contagion, the minister said, adding that micro-containment zones are being created wherever two to three Covid-19 cases are detected.What are the positivity rates in other states?In Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, the positivity rate stands at 14.6 per cent. Out of the 2,07,15,793 laboratory samples, which were taken until today, 30,57,885 have tested positive for Covid-19, the state government\\'s health department showed.Punjab, another badly affected state, has seen its positivity rate grow at a fast pace.

Both Tehran and Washington did not foresee any early breakthrough.\"We are not optimistic nor pessimistic about the outcome of this meeting now, but we are confident that we are on the right track, and if America\\'s will, seriousness and honesty is proven, it could be a good sign for a better future for this agreement and ultimately its full implementation,\" Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters.US and Iranian officials will begin indirect talks in the Austrian capital, where the pact was originally reached in 2015, later on Tuesday. Officials from Britain, France and Germany, are expected to act as intermediaries. Russia and China, the other parties to the 2015 pact, will also attend.A Western diplomat told Reuters on Friday that a shuttle-diplomacy approach would be adopted. The diplomat said France would be the main interlocutor for both sides.According to diplomats, the remaining parties to the deal will first meet at a Viennese hotel for preparatory talks. The US delegation, headed by special envoy Rob Malley, will be based in a nearby hotel.Adding fresh doubt to chances of a breakthrough, an Iranian official told Reuters: \"Our agenda during the meeting will be removal of all U.S. sanctions against Iran ... as our supreme leader has said repeatedly, anything less than that will not be accepted by Tehran.\"Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, has opposed any gradual easing of sanctions.An EU official said working groups would be created with the aim of marrying lists of sanctions that the United States could lift and nuclear obligations that Iran should meet.Diplomats said Tuesday\\'s talks could continue for several days to resolve some of the easier issues before resuming next week. The aim is some form of a deal ahead of June\\'s Iranian presidential election, the official said, although Iranian and US officials have said there is no rush.President Joe Biden\\'s administration wants to revive the accord but has said that this requires negotiations. Tehran has dismissed any engagement in talks with Washington about both sides resuming compliance with the deal.Under the 2015 accord, US and other economic sanctions on Tehran were removed in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme to make it harder to develop a nuclear weapon - an ambition Tehran denies.

              " \" Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari's custody handed over to UP Police  The Uttar Pradesh Police on Tuesday took custody of jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari at Punjab's Rupnagar jail to transfer him to Banda prison.Ansari, BSP MLA from Uttar Pradesh's Mau, is facing 52 cases in the state and elsewhere, and 15 of them are in the trial stage.Punjab Additional Director General of Police (Prisons), Praveen Kumar Sinha, told PTI that the custody of Ansari has been handed over to the Uttar Pradesh Police.Ansari, who has been lodged in the Rupnagar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case, was taken in an ambulance, jail officials said.Earlier, Uttar Pradesh Police vehicles, an ambulance and a Vajra reached Rupnagar jail at around 12 noon.Uttar Pradesh Police personnel reached Rupnagar district on Tuesday to bring back Ansari.Heavy security arrangements were made by the Punjab Police outside the Rupnagar jail. Barricades were also put by the police on the road leading to the jail.The Supreme Court had directed the Punjab government to handover the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.It had also said that a convict or an under-trial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be helpless bystanders when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.

              " ' Phase 3: TMC, BJP continue to accuse each other of polling malpractices  West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday alleged “blatant misuse” of central forces to “influence voters” as ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its main challenger, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), again accused each of malpractices during the third phase of polling for 31 seats in the state. In a tweet, Banerjee shared a screengrab of a scuffle between BJP and TMC supporters in Goghat. “The blatant misuse of Central forces continues unabated. Despite us repeatedly raising this issue, @ECISVEEP continues to be a mute spectator while men in uniform are being misused at several places to openly intimidate TMC voters & influence many to vote in favour of one party.” Clashes and allegations of malpractices also marred the second phase of elections in West Bengal on April 1 as Banerjee threatened to move court over alleged irregularities, prompting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hit back. Modi said Banerjee was nervous about losing Nandigram, which went to the polls on April 1 and where the chief minister contested against her former aide-turned-BJP-candidate Suvendu Adhikari. Also Read | West Bengal: BJP worker’s mother allegedly killed by TMC in Hooghly’s GoghatBanerjee spent the second phase crisscrossing Nandigram. She visited a polling booth in Boyal and criticised the EC for alleged inaction over complaints of rigging. She also alleged that central forces were intimidating voters and backing BJP candidates. As she spoke, TMC and BJP workers faced off outside and hurled bricks and traded abuses. Banerjee called Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankar to complain. A police contingent was rushed to Boyal where Banerjee was finally escorted out around one-and-a-half hours later. On Tuesday, Dipak Haldar, the BJP candidate from Diamond Harbour, accused TMC of preventing voters from getting into polling stations. “TMC men are not allowing BJP supporters to come out and vote freely, and unfortunately, the central forces are mute spectators,” said Haldar, who is among those who defected to BJP from TMC in the runup to the polls. TMC dismissed the allegations as “baseless”. Minister Asima Patra accused the central forces of high-handedness and alleged “BJP goons” stopped voters from coming to the polling stations in Dhanekhali. BJP activists allegedly assaulted TMC candidate Najmul Karim in Khanakul before central forces rescued him. In Arambagh, BJP workers allegedly threatened TMC supporters. Madhabi Adak, a BJP supporter’s mother, was allegedly killed in Hooghly district hours before the commencement of polling in the area. She succumbed to her injuries sustained while protecting her son after a group of men barged into their house and attacked him. Adak’s family accused TMC of the assault. The EC suspended a polling officer in Howrah’s Uluberia after four spare Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines were allegedly found at a TMC’s leader’s house, an official of the election watchdog said. The EC official did not name the leader. But Chiran Bera, BJP’s candidate from Uluberia Uttar, claimed the machines were found at the residence of Goutam Ghosh, who is a TMC booth president. “A few villagers saw two vehicles outside the leader’s [Ghosh] house and inquired. When they came to know that the sector officer has come [with the machines], they informed me,” said Bera. Nirmal Maji, TMC candidate from the area, did not take calls for a response. HT also reached out to other TMC leaders for a reaction but did not get any immediately. The EC official said the suspended sector officer had gone to the leader’s house, who is his relative, to sleepover along with the machines. After the matter came to light, villagers staged a protest in the area. A police contingent was sent to the spot to disperse the crowd and bring the situation under control. “We have suspended the sector officer. The EVMs and VVPAT machines, which were recovered, were kept as reserve,” the official said, requesting anonymity. The official added the machines have been withdrawn from the poll process and replaced by new ones. “All the political parties have been informed. Action is also likely to be taken against police personnel.” Howrah is among the districts where the polling is underway. Elections have been staggered in West Bengal over eight phases. Over 7.8 million voters are eligible to vote and 205 candidates, including BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta and state minister Ashima Patra, are contesting the third phase of the elections. The EC has imposed restrictions on the assembly of over four people across all the constituencies going to the polls in the third phase and declared them sensitive. A 34.71% turnout was recorded till 11 am as the voting was underway with adherence to Covid-19 protocols. Over 80% of the eligible voters voted in the second phase and 79.8% in the first. Results for the 294-seat assembly will be declared on May 2. The BJP, which emerged as the second-biggest party in West Bengal in the 2019 national polls, is hoping to wrest power for the first time in the state. TMC is hoping to get a third straight term.

The upcoming season will be a crucial one for the franchise as they enter the ring under the leadership of first-time skipper Rishabh Pant.The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman was given the responsibility after regular captain Shreyas Iyer was ruled out due to a shoulder injury. Before the league commences, head coach Ricky Ponting has backed captain Pant, stating that the youngster will enjoy the extra responsibility.“I think extra responsibility is going to sit really well with him. He's that sort of a person that likes the responsibility, wants to be the main man and wants to be the leader, so I am really excited to see how he goes. We'll help him through, but honestly, I don't think he's going to need much help at all,” Ponting was quoted as saying in a media release.Also Read | Chopra picks ideal RCB XI for IPL 2021, leaves out 2 prominent AustraliansThe former Australian skipper added that it will be part of the coaching staff and the senior players’ job to support the newly appointed Captain in any way they can.“I think if we can get most of the talking with Rishabh about his captaincy done, leading into the first game then we don't have to worry about it as the tournament starts.

Not only during training, but during matches as well,” Ponting added.Ponting further expressed that Pant's performances in the last few months have been nothing short of breath-taking.“I have known how talented Rishabh is since the moment I laid eyes on him. When he got back into the Test squad in Australia, I actually made a comment before a ball was bowled in the second Test match that this will be the unearthing of a 15-year Test player for India. I think he’s on track for doing that. His cricket in the last six-seven months has been nothing short of breath-taking and outstanding,” Ponting said.

Cricket boards and countries have created strict bio-bubbles for the safety of cricketers during tours and tournaments. Players are placed under a bio-bubble where they are only allowed to move in a restricted space and interact with a limited number of people. Several overseas players have spoken about the bio-bubbles and how it is tough on their mental health. Team India has also continued to play non-stop cricket since IPL 2020. After the T20 tournament, India went on the tour of Australia, then played England in a full-fledged series and are now gearing up for IPL 2021. They have also been placed in bio-bubbles for months. Commenting on bio-bubbles, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has said that Indians are \"more tolerant\" to deal with mental health issues than cricketers from countries like England and Australia.Ever since the international cricket resumed, the players have been forced to stay in bio-bubbles, where their life is restricted to hotels and stadiums.They do not have access to people outside the bubble, making it extremely difficult for players to stay fresh and motivated.\"I feel we Indians are a bit more tolerant than overseas (cricketers).

              " ' Financial regulator asks G20 countries to prepare Covid-19 relief exit plan  While ending Covid-19 economic relief measures too soon would present more of a threat to financial stability than leaving them in place too long, it was time for G20 countries to decide how it should be done, the Financial Stability Board said on Tuesday.The FSB, which coordinates financial rules for the G20 group of rich nations, said the speedy, sizeable and sweeping measures introduced by governments in the past year have limited economic fallout from the Covid-19 shock, but phasing them out will also present risks given continued uncertainties.Despite the arrival of vaccines, the withdrawal of relief measures is not imminent given the pandemic is worse in some countries than had been anticipated a few months ago, the FSB said.In a report to help G20 countries exit the measures, the FSB recommended a flexible approach that withdraws relief gradually in a sequenced way to avoid a \"cliff edge\" effect from simultaneous expiries.Withdrawals could be based on narrowing the scope of relief measures, requiring beneficiaries to opt in, making the support progressively less generous, and sequencing the expiry of different relief.A \"state-contingent\" approach rather than a pre-announced timetable for withdrawal could help to minimize long-term financial stability risks, the FSB said.\"For many support measures, authorities need to take a decision on whether to extend, amend or unwind them,\" the FSB said in its report for G20 finance ministers meeting virtually this week.\"Prematurely withdrawing temporary measures designed to support bank lending could lead to an unintended tightening of bank lending.\"FSB Chair Randal Quarles, said in a letter to G20 members there were signs of an emerging \"inflection point\" as vaccines are rolled out, albeit at different paces.\"While it is sensible to keep measures that support financial system stability and financing of the real economy in place as long as needed, the factors to be considered in deciding whether to extend, amend and, eventually, end support measures are taking shape,\" said Quarles, who is also vice chair for supervision at the US Federal Reserve.

              " ' BJP categorises Bengal constituencies, says Nandigram not ‘a tough contest’  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has classified each of West Bengal’s 294 constituencies into one of three categories, A, B, and C, depending on the nature of the contest, according to six BJP leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity. A refers to an easy win, B, a contest, and C, a very tough contest. Nandigram, where Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is taking on Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP is in category B, HT learns.On record, however, the BJP says none of the 294 seats are difficult. “It is the first time our party has gone to 80,000 of the total 100,000 polling booths that we have across the state. We have classified them, but it is our internal preparation. It is our strategy but we hope that people will vote for us whichever category the constituency is,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya, national general secretary in charge of Bengal. Home minister Amit Shah has repeatedly said the BJP will win at least 200 seats.Also Read | ‘Misuse of forces’: Mamata rages again as Phase 3 polling underway in BengalWhen asked specifically about CM’s constituency, Vijayvargiya said “Nandigram is in our A category.”The categorisation has been done by top BJP strategists , and the list itself is with only some of the party’s top leaders and campaigners, HT has learnt.One of the people cited in the first instance said that while Nandigram looks like a contest, “the BJP may be slightly ahead.”Similarly, Tollygunge where Union Minister Babul Supriyo is fighting from is also in category B, the people added.Supriyo acknowledged that he has been given a tough seat, but added that he is confident of winning. “It is a serious but also a ground zero assessment of the organisation in terms of the constituencies which need extra support,’’ he said of his constituency’s categorisation.So which are the toughest or category C seats for the BJP? The internal survey says that these are the constituencies mostly in South Bengal -- Swarupnagar, Baranagar, Basanti, Jagatballavpur, Khandagosh, Murarai, Nalgoti and Manbazar – that are dominated by the Trinamool Congress.Most of the headline grabbing constituencies, however, are in Category B. Other than Nandigram, Sitai, Moyna, Raipur, Kotulpur, Indas, Galsi, Katwa, Memari, and even Tarkeshwar, where former Rajya Sabha MP and journalist Swapan Dasgupta is fighting from, are all in this category. “I cannot comment on this because I have never come across such a survey,’’ said Dasgupta when contacted by HT.The easiest, or category A, seats for BJP include Onda, Bishnupur, Asansol (dakshin) , Para, Joypur, Shibpur, Khejuri, Medinipur, Howrah Uttar. Other than Howrah, they are mostly in the Western parts of the state.“We are winning Bengal. We have won Nandigram. The only Union minister contesting here will lose,” said Derek O’ Brien, TMCs leader in the Rajya Sabha.“In the western districts of Bengal, the BJP did better in 2019 so they classify them as easier seats to win. In southern and eastern Bengal, despite several charges of corruption against TMC, it has organisational presence so the BJP will face opposition from certain demographics,” said Dwaipayan Bhattacharya, professor for political science at JNU, explaining the logic behind the categorisation.

              " \" IPL 2021: Royal Challengers Bangalore - Team profile and full squad  Virat Kohli and his merry bunch of 'Royal Challengers' will look to win their maiden title once again when they hit the ground in IPL 2021. The team has lost three finals and made it to the play-offs last season. Yet, there has been a lot of chopping and changing as RCB continue to look for their best playing XI.The team lacks genuine match winners apart from Kohli and AB de Villiers and an unsettled bowling attack has been their bane over the years. Whether they can get beyond their weaknesses to win the title remains to be seen.RCB's best shot is to somehow make the play-offs and then expect a big performance from Kohli and ABD in the knock-outs. Unfortunately for them the script has gone awry for them far too many times. But they will not stop trying.Here is the full squad of Royal Challengers Bangalore for IPL 2021: Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Siraj, Kane Richardson, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Finn Allen, Shahbaz Ahamad, Navdeep Saini, Adam Zampa, Kyle Jamieson, Glenn Maxwell, Rajat Patidar, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Azharuddeen, Daniel Christian, KS Bharat, Suyash Prabhudessai, Daniel Sams, Harshal Patel.ALSO READ | IPL 2021: Mumbai Indians - Team profile and full squadStrengthsExplosive batting orderThe envious combination of Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers will have some added help this season with the addition of Glenn Maxwell. BBL big hitter Daniel Christian and domestic sensation Azharuddeen's addition means RCB have an explosive batting order.If that wasn’t enough you have local talents like Washington Sundar and Harshal Patel who have proven that they can use the long handle to good effect.Virat the OpenerWith Virat Kohli stating that he will open for RCB in the upcoming season, it changes the entire complexity of the side. Last time Kohli opened in an IPL season he scored close to 1000 runs. With Kohli opening they can play all their explosive batsman in the top 4.WeaknessMiddle order InconsistencyThough they have two of the most explosive middle order batsmen, the team has never been known for its consistency. Glenn Maxwell is yet to show the consistency he has shown for Australia. Barring AB de Villiers there is no player in the RCB middle-order who has proven his mettle in the IPL.Fast Bowling WoesRCB’s pace bowlers are young and talented but they lack experience. Siraj and Harshal Patel are the only bowlers to have played more than 30 IPL matches. The likes of Kyle Jamieson and Daniel Sams are relative newcomers to the IPL.ALSO READ | IPL 2021: Delhi Capitals - Team profile and full squadOpportunityPlaces up for GrabsThere are almost 5 places up for grabs in the RCB line-up ranging from middle order batsmen to spinning all-rounders to pace bowlers. Players like Harshal Patel, KS Bharat, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Azharuddeen, Kane Richardson, Dan Christian will have ample opportunities to cement their place in the playing XI.Home VenueRCB will be playing most of their matches at Eden Gardens. The long boundaries and the effectiveness of pace at the Eden pitch will serve RCB better than their home venue of Chinnaswamy Stadium. Their home win rate of 49.31% at the Chinnaswamy stadium should only get better at the Eden Gardens.Moreover, with Eden Gardens being one of the bigger grounds in the IPL, their spinners will have a slight advantage as opposed to bowling at Chinnaswamy.ThreatsWin ConsistencyRCB have been an explosive side throughout the IPL. The one thing they haven’t been able to do consistently is “WIN” matches. Also, RCB’s batting and bowling performing in the same match is a very rare phenomenon.The Form of Virat KohliThe form of Virat Kohli is directly proportional to RCB’s form. Even if RCB has the likes of AB de Villiers and Glenn Maxwell who are match winners, RCB fortunes have rested on the shoulders of Virat Kohli’s form.

Outgoing CJI Sharad Arvind Bobde, who is retiring on April 23, recommended Justice Ramana's name as his preferred successor, which the President duly accepted. On April 24, the next CJI will be sworn into office and he will have a term till August 26, 2022.Justice Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana's nearly four-decade-long career in law has seen him practising in at least two high courts, the Supreme Court, a number of administrative tribunals, and panel counsel of various government organisations, specialising in constitutional, criminal, service and inter-state river laws. He also served as the acting chief justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court and the chief justice of Delhi High Court, before being elevated as a judge of the Supreme Court of India.Born in agricultural family, took up advocacy in '83NV Ramana was born in an agricultural family on August 27, 1957, at the Ponnavaram village in Andhra Pradesh's Krishna district. Before becoming a full-fledged lawyer Ramana worked as a journalist for a leading Telugu newspaper for a brief time. He enrolled as an advocate in 1983 and practised in the high court of Andhra Pradesh, Central and Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunals and the Supreme Court of India in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election-related matters.Later, Justice Ramana worked as the additional standing counsel for the central government, the standing counsel for the Indian Railways in the Central Administrative Tribunal at Hyderabad, and the additional advocate general of Andhra Pradesh. In the summer of 2000, he was appointed as a permanent judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court, where he held his post before serving as the acting chief justice for two months in 2013. He was transferred to Delhi as its chief justice before he elevated to the Supreme Court on September 2, later that year.Supreme Court careerJustice NV Ramana has been a judge in the Supreme Court since February 17, 2014. He has also served as the executive chairman of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) since November 27, 2019. On April 6, 2021 (Tuesday), the warrant of appointment as CJI was handed over to Justice Ramana by the secretary of the department of justice. As a Chief Justice of India, he would have a tenure of sixteen months and his term will come to an end on August 26, 2022.Lifting Jammu and Kashmir internet banAs a Supreme Court judge, Justice Ramana rendered many major judgments, chief of which was bringing an end to a year-long internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir in 2020 after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution in August 2019. Noting that the indefinite internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir is not only a violation of the telecom rules but also of the freedom of speech and expression granted by the Constitution, Justice Ramana had lifted the restriction on internet access in the valley, as per an ANI report.Bringing CJI's office under RTI's ambitIn a major breakthrough for transparency, Justice Ramana had, in another significant judgment, brought the office of the Chief Justice of India under the ambit of the Right to Information (RTI) Act.Conducting floor test in MaharashtraIn addition to these landmark judgments, Justice NV Ramana also ruled in favour of conducting a floor test in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, paving the way for an end to the practice of 'horse trading' during the 2019 Maharashtra political crisis, when the Shiv Sena, the BJP, and the National Congress Party and others were trying to form the state government.

              " ' Bollywood’s release calendar goes for a toss, yet again  2021 was looking like the year of Bollywood’s resurgence. Announcements for new films were being made one after the other, shoots were getting started and wrapped up as well. But the Covid pandemic refuses to slow down, and hence Maharashtra theatres have been shut till April 30. This in turn has led to filmmakers rethinking about their releases.Rohit Shetty has postponed the already delayed Sooryavanshi, again. What happens to the rest of the biggies- Thalaivi in April, Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai and Satayameva Jayate 2 in May, and so on? Does the entire year seem set for a reshuffle?Experts and makers believe so. Producer Anand Pandit, who has delayed the theatrical release of his Amitabh Bachchan starrer Chehre, says, “Unfortunately, we have only got 52 Fridays in a year, and there are usually 300-400 films. Entire months of April and May will go, I am sure films will start releasing only after June. It will disturb the whole calendar.”Rajender Jyala, Chief Programming Officer, INOX Leisure, says while south releases are on track so far, Hindi films will change their dates. “Sooryavanshi will have to find a new release date now. We don’t know when the theatres will reopen. Once that clarity comes, then the re scheduling will happen in the whole lineup,” he says.RELEASE SANS MAHARASHTRA?Jyala adds that these are tough times indeed for theatres. “There is no income. We are hopeful that this time, we will open very soon. The government has expedited the vaccination drive. It’s highly unlikely that makers will choose to release big film in other states barring Maharashtra. Smaller films, yes, maybe. Maharashtra contributes 30-35 percent of all India box office. Even earlier when Maharashtra theatres reopened at 50 percent capacity, other cinemas in the country were open, and films were releasing. Films will release, but not those on a bigger scale. For that, Maharashtra theatres have to reopen,” he explains.Exhibitors agree and say that no filmmaker would want to release their film without the Maharashtra revenue. Akshaye Rathi tells us, “Films releasing in April or early May will obviously reconsider their plans. Given the fact that Maharashtra is shutting down, it’s possibly the biggest market in terms of box office revenue for Hindi films. With that out of the equation, no producer would want to release in other belts. Most Hindi and Hollywood films this month are planning to change dates. The impact of Maharashtra is on the other parts of the country as well. It is extremely damaging, after close to a year of being shut.”OTT ROUTE INSTEAD?Will filmmakers who can’t wait anymore for theatres to reopen, opt for OTT releases instead? The mounting costs for delaying a release might compel some. But Pandit, whose film The Big Bull will premiere on a streaming platform, reasons, “There is no general thumb rule. Small films may go for it. I don’t think any OTT player will be able to match the numbers for big films like Sooryavanshi . It’s very unlikely they will go to OTTs. There was no economic reason behind me releasing TBT on OTT. We are a zero debt company, so we don’t have that pressure mounting on us. We thought it would be a good bet for OTT, as there was demand for good content there. Chehre would be a beautiful experience for cinema goers, that is why we are holding on to it for a theatrical.”Trade expert Atul Mohan also says the situation is uncertain as to when will theatres in Maharashtra be functional again. “It’s not assured that cinemas will reopen on May 1. Whether it will get extended or not, there is no clarity. Hindi films won’t release elsewhere therefore, as they can’t afford to lose such a big market,” he says.Interact with the author on Twitter/ @RishabhSuri02Follow @htshowbiz on Twitter SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",
              " ' Shweta Tripathi Sharma: Covid ke baad, body ki band baj jati hai  Shweta Tripathi Sharma had tested positive for Covid-19 a month ago and though recovered, she says she doesn’t feel a 100% fit.“Though it has been so long, my sense of taste and smell isn’t the same. It doesn’t feel like they are back completely and workouts, too, aren’t as usual. Physically, I am okay but I don’t have enough energy to workout. It seems my muscles don’t have the strength that they used to,” says Sharma, who was shooting for an ad, and was feeling fine but at the end of the day, her body felt like never before. “I had a high temperature and I felt tired and exhausted in a very different way, no like one feels after a 14-hour shoot. In that moment, I sensed it was Covid-19. Once I reached home, I felt better but the next morning, I had the fever again so I went into isolation and got tested. What you feel bad about is that shoots are stalled or cancelled because of you but my producers were understanding and wonderful. The most difficult part of being positive is the isolation. You are watching and reading yet you don’t feel don’t like doing anything. I was eating a lot. I checked with friends who had tested positive, they too felt the same. My husband, Cheetah, too tested positive after a few days, so we were in isolation together and we got some good time together as he didn’t have any symptoms. Now, we won’t see each other for two months as we are both shooting (laughs),” quips the Mirzapur actor. While it has been a year and people are getting “irritated” about staying at home, sanitising, social distancing, and wearing masks, it is the need of the hour, urges Sharma. “We have not understood Covid in totality yet. Every body reacts differently and has different symptoms. Please take care of yourself and your family. Please work with the government and follow all guidelines. Even if you are asymoptomatic, your body will take a toll. It will affect your body. Having said that, I would like to add that treat Covid like a flu. Don’t be scared as panic will lead to more panic,” she concludes. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

Most in the queue were young Pakistanis still not eligible for the government's free vaccination, reported TRTWorld.While the private sale of vaccines has begun, the government and importers are still locked in a pricing dispute.Pakistan initially agreed to exempt imported vaccines from price caps, but later rescinded the exemption and said it would set maximum prices.One pharmaceutical company, which had already imported 50,000 doses of Sputnik V, took the government to court, where it won an interim order allowing it to sell it until pricing is decided, reported TRTWorld.The number of patients now in critical care has reached 3,568, the highest since the pandemic started, a cabinet minister, Asad Umar, said on Twitter.Pakistan has thus far reported 687,908 infections and 14,778 deaths, reported TRTWorld.

              " ' Assam University students’ demand for online examination rejected  Offline examinations for odd-semesters of undergraduate courses in Assam University have begun from Tuesday after authorities rejected protesting students’ demand for online examination in the wake of a rise in Covid-19 cases, said officials.Students of about 15 colleges, affiliated to the varsity in the three districts of the Barak Valley, protested for three days till Monday evening, but the varsity and district authorities cited official guidelines to reject their demand following a late evening meeting at Cachar deputy commissioner’s office in Assam’s Silchar.The students, who have been protesting against offline examinations since Saturday, blocked Cachar deputy commissioner’s office on Monday evening and were dispersed only after the police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel cited prohibitory orders under Section 144, imposed in the district on the eve of the third and final phase of assembly elections in the state, and threatened them with a lathicharge. “Assam University is discriminating between campus students and students of affiliated colleges. Despite the threat of Covid-19, they are denying our demand. This is injustice. If a student gets infected during the examination and dies, will the university take responsibility?,” asked a student, who didn’t wish to be named.Following the protest, the district administration called a meeting of Assam University officials, principals of colleges and representatives of students. The colleges unanimously supported the decision to conduct offline examinations. “Assam University is not the competent authority to assess the Covid situation. It is the district administration or the state government’s job to issue an advisory, which guides our decision. When the Dibrugarh University is conducting offline examination, the election commission is conducting elections, a Mela is happening in Silchar, when everything is open, how can Assam University take a decision not to conduct offline examination? We are following the Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) issued by the ministry of home affairs, which instructs universities to open in a phase-wise manner,” said Pradosh Kiran Nath, Assam University registrar.Additional deputy commissioner Dipak Jidung said, “We cannot influence the university’s decision unless it hampers the law and order situation in our district. The university authority asked us to give an advisory whether it is unsafe to conduct offline examination at this moment due to Covid. Though the number of Covid cases are increasing in the country, we don’t have any instructions from the state government to stop offline examinations.”Presently, there are 16 active cases of Covid in Cachar district and the last death due the disease in the district was reported two weeks back.

              " ' Myanmar protesters paint Yangon red, defying bloody army crackdown  Opponents of Myanmar\\'s military junta sprayed red paint on roads in the country\\'s biggest city on Tuesday to mark the deaths of hundreds of \"martyrs\" killed by troops, as the crisis dragged on with no clear diplomatic solution in sight.Some 570 people have been killed during nearly two months of unrest since the military coup on Feb. 1, and security forces have arrested close to 3,500 people, with about four-fifths of them still in detention, advocacy group the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said on Tuesday.Demonstrators woke early in Yangon to spray and splash pavements, roads and bus shelters with red paint in protest at a sweeping crackdown by security forces that has caused weeks of international outrage.\"The blood has not dried,\" said one message in red.Another daubed across a bus shelter took aim at rank-and-file soldiers who it said were being exploited by kleptocratic generals.\"Don\\'t kill people just for a small salary as low as the cost of dog food,\" it said.Anger has swept Myanmar in the past two months over the return of a military government and an abrupt end to a brief era of democratic and economic reform and international integration that was absent under the military\\'s oppressive 1962-2011 rule.Some protesters have called their movement a \"spring revolution\", characterised by street marches, quirky acts of non-violent rebellion and civil disobedience campaigns aimed at crippling the government apparatus.Internet blackoutsTheir ability to organise may have been hampered in recent days by the military\\'s halt of broadband wireless internet, adding to a weeks-long block of mobile data services which had been the main channel for spreading word of what was happening in the country during the crackdown.Those able to access social media, including some journalists, on Tuesday shared pictures of striking workers marching for a second day in the city of Mandalay, some wearing gas masks and giving the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of resistance to army rule.A day earlier, demonstrators held placards of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi and signs calling for international intervention.Authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of celebrities, models and influencers, and on Tuesday a popular comedian was arrested in Yangon, the Mizzima news site reported.Sithu Aung Myint, a prominent journalist, was on the wanted list. Writing on Facebook, he said he was proud to be considered a threat.\"When the coup council who have been committing crimes announces you as a lawbreaker together with the whole country, you will be more than happy because you are recognised as a hero in this revolution,\" he wrote.\"Your next generation will be proud of you.\"Protesters and workers have come out daily against the military takeover, which followed several years of awkward power-sharing between generals and Suu Kyi\\'s civilian government under a democratic system created by the army.Suu Kyi\\'s party won an election by landslide in November, and had pledged to change the constitution to reduce the military\\'s political clout.Despite the election commission saying the vote was fair, the military justified its coup by alleging that the ballot was fraudulent, and has promised to hold a new election at an unspecified time.Diplomatic EffortOn Monday, the military\\'s mouthpiece newspaper, the Global New Light of Myanmar, carried a banner quoting the junta\\'s leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.\"Democracy is based on the wish of the majority, but such a wish must be authentic with honest politics,\" it said.Min Aung Hlaing has sought to play down the unrest and dismissed international concern as misplaced, calling it an internal issue that the military was handling with \"utmost restraint\".Western countries have called for a restoration of Suu Kyi\\'s government, a position echoed by only a handful of Myanmar\\'s regional neighbours.Brunei, the chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Monday agreed to a meeting of its leaders over the crisis in Myanmar, though no date was set,ASEAN operates by consensus but the divergent views of its 10 members on how to respond to the army\\'s use of lethal force against civilians and the group\\'s policy of non-interference has limited its ability to act.

              " \" Right To Protein invites all to join Global Soy Month in April 2021  Mumbai, Maharashtra, India – Business Wire IndiaRight To Protein, one of India’s foremost protein awareness initiatives is inviting the nation to join countries around the world to commemorate the month of April as ‘Soy Month’ to spread awareness about protein-rich soy foods and soy-fed animal protein sources that help meet the daily protein requirements. Globally many countries recognize April as Soy Month. A nationally celebrated Soy Month will encourage Indian citizens at large to also learn and know more about different types of protein rich soy foods and their importance in daily meals for better nutrition and health. The month will also aim at bringing in increased focus on adequate quantity and quality of soy for human as well as animal consumption.Soy protein is known as a rich source of quality protein. Soy foods such as soy chunks, soybeans, soy milk, tofu, tempeh, etc., are not only a versatile source of protein to meet our daily protein requirements but also enable our body’s metabolic activities to work well. The micro and macro-nutrient contents in soybeans further helps growth, repairs tissue, builds muscle and renews cells. Moreover, soybeans are comparable to animal proteins like chicken, eggs and dairy products and help to meet the dietary demands of vegetarians, vegans, or flexitarians. Similarly, soy protein is known to be very valuable for animal nutrition. Soybean meals have been widely used in India and around the world to increase protein levels in animals for human consumption. ‘Soy-Fed’ meat and meat products that are being consumed around the world are becoming healthier and organic alternatives to other locally sold meat products.Nmami Agarwal, Nutritionist, Founder - Nmami Life and Supporter of Right To Protein says, “As we move forward with our larger aim of protein sufficiency, an initiative such as Soy Month can play an important role, especially for vegetarians, who are yet to discover the health benefits of consuming adequate amounts of this high protein source. Soy based foods such as soy chunks and soybeans are not new, and other foods like soy milk have already gained popularity among the urban citizens. However, we still need to increase awareness at a much larger level to present soy as a viable and economic protein option.”The key focus area for the Right To Protein initiative and its supporters throughout Soy Month will be to increase knowledge about the various soy foods that are available to the people and how to include them in daily diets. Moreover, this time will also be dedicated to starting correction of prevailing misinformation and myths around soybeans that have been a barrier to adequate consumption of this protein rich wholefood.“For a long time soy based foods have not received its fair share of attention due to myths and misinformation around them. Soy foods are definitely rich in protein. In fact, soybeans contain all of the essential amino acids that are necessary for human nutrition,” says Dr. Suresh Itapu, Nutraceutical Expert, Director - NutriTech India, Human Nutrition Consultant – USSEC and Supporter of the Right To Protein initiative.“We joined the Right To Protein initiative earlier this year to increase more awareness about plant protein, especially plant-based meats. Innovative applications of soy have ushered in a growing acceptance of meat alternatives and plant protein around the world and in India.

Right To Protein aims to develop an ecosystem of professionals to drive protein awareness and debunk myths and misconceptions about protein as a critical macro-nutrient for human health and of many protein foods sources. The ecosystem will aim to improve production and consumption quality and consistency of both, plant, and animal proteins.

              " \" IPL 2021: Delhi Capitals - Team profile and full squad  Delhi Capitals made it to their first ever IPL final last season, before being blown away by Mumbai Indians in the summit clash. DC has been an outfit which has improved tremendously under young captain Shreyas Iyer but unfortunately for them, Iyer will not be available to lead the team this year as he will miss this season with a shoulder injury.Swashbuckling wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant, who has been with the team for 5 seasons, has been named captain of the side and he will be looking to enhance his credentials as a match winner further.The team under the stewardship of Ricky Ponting has a good mix of experienced and young Indian cricketers and also a bunch of high impact overseas cricketers.Here is the full squad of Delhi Capitals for IPL 2021: Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Rishabh Pant , Shimron Hetmyer, Marcus Stoinis, Chris Woakes, R Ashwin, Axar Patel, Amit Mishra, Lalit Yadav, Pravin Dubey, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Ishant Sharma, Avesh Khan, Steve Smith, Umesh Yadav, Ripal Patel, Vishnu Vinod, Lukman Meriwala, M Siddarth, Tom Curran, Sam Billings.ALSO READ | IPL 2021: Mumbai Indians - Team profile and full squadStrengthsPacersDC has the most formidable pace attack this season. K Rabada & A Nortje have been retained. Their weakness of a 3rd seamers from last season has also been covered in the form of U Yadav & L Meriwala.Add Ishant Sharma to that list (didn’t play last season due to injury) & the pace attack is unrivaled.Explosive FinishersWith the likes of Pant, Stoinis, Hetmyer & Axar Patel in the middle & lower middle-order, the finishing power of DC is one of the finest and next only to perhaps Mumbai Indians. While Stoinis can play anywhere & Pant’s current form make him among the most dangerous finishers in the game. Axar Patel has a few lofty hits in him while Hetmyer is impossible to stop on his day.ALSO READ | He looked me in the eye & said 'No, I'm not batting': Ricky Ponting on when Prithvi Shaw refused to bat in DC netsWeaknessWicket-keeping OptionsBarring Rishabh Pant there is no recognised Indian keeper in the side. While V Vinod is a viable option, but his finishing abilities are nowhere near Pant. Sam Billings is another option that is available but to bring in an overseas player, the entire composition of the team will have to be changed to accommodate him.Lack of quality all-roundersAxar Patel and Marcus Stoinis are the only 2 renowned IPL all-rounders DC have in their team. If any one of them were to get injured during the season they might have to depend on the likes of Lalit Yadav or Ripal Patel. Chris Woakes is another option they can turn too but he has been a no-show in the last couple of seasons.OpportunityOpening SpotDC is a squad who have no less than 4 openers in Dhawan, Shaw, Rahane and even Steve Smith. Stoinis as we know has done a great job opening the innings in the shortest form of the game. Looking at previous year’s performances, Dhawan will most probably keep his place but his partner’s place is up for grabs.Shaw will come into the side with a record-breaking Vijay Hazare trophy and will be eager to get his spot back. Smith has proven he can be as good as any opener in T20s. Stoinis did well last season in the opening spot and there is no reason why he shouldn’t open the innings.Billings/Hetmyer: The fight for a permanent spotA lower order big hitter or a stable no.3? Both Billings and Hetmyer fit the bill. While Billings has shown glimpses of what he can do, Hetmyer hasn’t proven himself last season when he was given the chances.ThreatsInjury-prone senior playersIshant Sharma, Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Umesh Yadav are all prone to injury. If both Ishant and Umesh were to be injured the 3rd pacer syndrome will catch up once again to DC. An injury to Amit Mishra and Ravi Ashwin will leave Axar Patel alone like last season. Though they have youngsters like Meriwala, Siddharth and Pravin Dubey to call upon, DC won’t be sure if they are as impactful as their senior colleagues.

              " ' Certain high BP medications may alter heart risk in people with HIV: Study  With current anti-retroviral medications, people with HIV are able to live longer. However, people with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) are more likely to develop high blood pressure (hypertension) and hypertension-related heart problems than people who do not have the virus.The current study is the first to examine how the choice of blood pressure medications influences the long-term risk of heart disease, stroke and heart failure in this population that has a higher risk of CVD.\"We suspected there could be differences in risk based on which medications providers select to treat hypertension among people with HIV due to potential interactions between blood pressure medications and some therapies used to treat the virus. Additionally, factors such as how the body handles salt, inflammation and the accelerated aging of blood vessels may affect the risk of cardiac events in people with HIV differently than people who do not have HIV, which could be influenced by which blood pressure medication is used,\" said the study\\'s senior author Jordana B. Cohen, M.D., M.S.C.E., assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology in the renal-electrolyte and hypertension division in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.In the current study, the researchers reviewed records of 8,041 veterans with HIV (average age 53 years, 97 per cent male, 49 per cent Black adults) who developed high blood pressure between 2000-2018; 6,516 had never been diagnosed with heart or blood vessel problems.At baseline, of the 8,041 patients, 5,979 (74 per cent) were on antiretroviral medication therapy and 6,582 (82 per cent) were prescribed single antihypertensive medication therapy: 1,025 (13 per cent) on beta-blockers, 848 (11 per cent) on calcium channel blockers, 1,905 (24 per cent) on ACEi/ARBs and 1,865 (23 per cent) on diuretics.The occurrence of heart disease (heart attack, heart-related chest pain, or need for a procedure to open narrowed arteries supplying blood to the heart), stroke or heart failure over the next 6.5 years was compared among the study participants based on the different types of blood pressure medications.Researchers found:In this study, 13 per cent of the veterans with HIV were prescribed beta-blockers as their initial hypertension treatment. Single-medication treatment was started with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs) in 24 per cent of patients; thiazide or similar diuretics in 23 per cent; and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in 11 per cent.During the mean 6.5 years follow-up period, 25 per cent of the veterans experienced a cardiovascular event. Among veterans who had not been diagnosed with heart disease at the beginning of the study, the risk of developing heart disease, heart failure or stroke for the first time was 90 per cent higher among those taking beta-blockers compared to the veterans who were taking ACEi/ARBs, the most frequently prescribed type of high blood pressure medication.The increased risk was present whether or not blood pressure was under control. Thiazide diuretics and CCBs did not increase risk.Among veterans with HIV who did not have chronic kidney disease, the use of ACEi/ARBs was associated with a lower risk of developing heart failure, compared to those patients taking other medications who were found to have about a 50 per cent higher risk of heart failure.\"Blood pressure and heart disease risk in patients who have HIV can be safely managed with first-line treatment of hypertension with ACEis, ARBs, CCBs and thiazide diuretics and may have added benefit from initial treatment with ACEis and ARBs,\" Cohen said.Although CCBs are among the medications recommended for the initial treatment of hypertension, in this study beta-blockers were prescribed more frequently than CCBs.\"We were surprised by the high rates of beta-blockers prescribed for first-line hypertension treatment since they are not recommended as first-line agents,\" Cohen said.Cohen further noted, \"We suspect this may be due to the fact that many people with HIV receive primary care from their infectious disease team, who do an amazing job at managing HIV but may not be focused on blood pressure treatment guidelines and contraindications. Ideally, a patient\\'s primary care and infectious disease team should work together for the best possible outcomes.\"Cohen said the results also highlight that there is possible harm from sing beta-blockers as first-line treatment for hypertension whether a person has HIV or not.\"While many people are appropriately treated with beta-blockers for various reasons, if you think you are taking them only for hypertension and aren\\'t on any other blood pressure medications, I\\'d recommend talking to your doctor to make sure it\\'s the best medication for you,\" she said.As a retrospective analysis, the study cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship between medication choice and heart disease events. The study results may also be affected by factors the researchers were unable to measure, such as some sociodemographic factors and patient preferences in medication choice.Although the results were the same in men and women in the study, the large proportion of men in the sample limits the ability to generalize the findings to women. Results from this study of veterans receiving care through the Veterans Health Administration also may not be generalizable to non-veterans or people who do not have health insurance or access to routine medical care.\"Patients with HIV need heightened attention to their elevated risk of heart disease. More dedicated research studying the unique needs for people with HIV and those taking ARTs is needed in order to optimize cardiovascular prevention,\" Cohen concluded.

              " ' Hanuma Vihari set for county stint with Warwickshire  The Indian Premier League franchises turned him down but Team India\\'s Test specialist Hanuma Vihari is all set to prepare for the upcoming six-Test season in the United Kingdom by competing for English county side Warwickshire.The right-handed middle-order batsman has already left for the UK and will be a part of the Birmingham based county side for at least three games this season.\"Yes, Vihari will be playing in the English county side for Warwickshire this season. He would play a few games. He is already in England now,\" a senior BCCI official confirmed the development to PTI on Tuesday.The Warwickshire county\\'s official page hasn\\'t made the announcement yet but as per BCCI officials, the modalities are being worked out.\"The contract is being chalked out. He will play a minimum of three games. We are trying to figure out if there is a chance to play a few more,\" an official said.Vihari last played in the IPL back in 2019 for Delhi Capitals and since then has gone unsold at the successive auctions after being billed as a Test specialist.The 27-year-old has scored 624 runs in 12 Tests for India at an average of 32 plus. He has hit a hundred and four half centuries.Vihari\\'s last India outing was in the Sydney Test against Australia, where his epic four-hour vigil (23 not out), with a torn hamstring alongside Ravichandran Ashwin, saved the game for the visiting team.He came back after an intense rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru but had an indifferent Vijay Hazare Trophy for Andhra, scoring only a single half-century and failing to reach double digits in the next five games.\"With a curtailed domestic season this time and Vihari being a part of the Test side, he needs match practice.\"All his other Test colleagues are part of the IPL teams including Cheteshwar (Pujara). Even if it\\'s white ball games, they will be fit and match-ready,\" the source said.\"However, we need to ensure that Vihari also gets game time before the England tour. It\\'s not just one World Test Championship final but it\\'s followed by a full-fledged five-Test series. We need him ready,\" he added.Over the years, the BCCI has encouraged a lot of its cricketers to go and play county cricket, especially before the England tours.Ishant Sharma, when he wasn\\'t a part of the IPL, had gone to Sussex and became a better red ball bowler during the past few years.Ashwin and Axar Patel have also played county cricket in recent years.The most high-profile name which was supposed to play country cricket (in 2018) but missed out due to injury was Indian captain Virat Kohli, who had a contract with Surrey.

              " \" IPL 2021: Mumbai Indians - Team profile and full squad  Mumbai Indians enter the 14th edition of IPL looking to do what has never been achieved in the history of the tournament. Rohit Sharma and his men will be looking to make it a hat-trick of titles after winning the tournament in the last two seasons. The level of the team's dominance can be gauged from the fact that they have won five of the last eight titles.Here is the full squad of Mumbai Indians for IPL 2021: Rohit Sharma, Quinton de Kock (WK), Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan (WK), Chris Lynn, Anmolpreet Singh, Saurabh Tiwary, Aditya Tare, Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Anukul Roy, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent Boult, Rahul Chahar, Jayant Yadav, Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter Nile, Adam Milne, Piyush Chawla, James Neesham, Yudhvir Charak, Marco Jansen, Arjun TendulkarALSO READ: Mumbai Indians have the potential to go where no other IPL team has beforeStrengthsCore Group of playersMumbai Indians have retained their entire playing XI from the last season leaving out space for just one more player. Moreover, they have players like Rohit Sharma, Kieron Pollard, Jasprit Bumrah, Krunal Pandya and Hardik Pandya in their starting line-up who have been with the side for 5 or more years. Their strong core of Indian players also makes them one of the most consistent sides in the IPL.Match-winnersMI have no less than 6 match winners in their playing XI. Rohit Sharma and Quinton de Kock are one of the most explosive opening pairs in the IPL currently and can outplay the opposition before the match even reaches mid-way.Suryakumar Yadav has proven his worth time and again to adapt and deliver match-winning knocks. Jasprit Bumrah is the 3rd bowler to scalp 100 wickets for MI which undoubtedly makes him a match winner. The lower middle order partnership of Pollard and Pandya is not only explosive but scarily consistent which makes it impossible to write MI out of any contest.WeaknessIndian Backup for Jasprit BumrahJasprit Bumrah has led the Mumbai Indians attack taking over from his mentor Lasith Malinga. If he were to get injured by any chance then the backup Indian bowlers are Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohsin Khan and Arjun Tendulkar. With the depth that MI have they can easily rotate to accommodate an extra overseas all-rounder but the likes of Neesham and untested Marco Jensen make it a huge risk.ALSO READ - IPL 2021, Sanju Samson Interview: Got texts from Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni after I became RR captainLack of a quality finger spinnerRahul Chahar has done well for them in the past seasons and they also added the experienced Piyush Chawla to the squad but the team lacks depth in this department and this could be their achilles heel while playing in India.Krunal Pandya has done well in patches and your other options are Anukul Roy and Jayant Yadav who have little to no experience of playing in the IPL.With MI playing 5 matches at Chennai, lack of a quality finger spinner might come back to haunt them.OpportunityHistory BeckonsMI became only the second side to win the IPL title in consecutive years when they won the tournament in UAE last year. They also broke their jinx of not winning a trophy in an even year. If MI manage to win the title this season, they will be the first franchise to win the IPL title in 3 consecutive seasons.ThreatsA Weak benchThe players sitting on the bench for MI haven’t been exposed to the IPL which makes it absolutely necessary for the starting XI to be in top condition of the whole of IPL. Players like Dhawal Kulkarni, James Neesham and Adam Milne are far from your options when you consider them to replace players like Bumrah, Pollard and Pandya.No Home AdvantageNo team has thrived on home advantage like MI at Wankhede winning 61.2% of their matches at Wankhede. Although their record at Chennai isn’t that bad but it will be a huge task to make Chennai the fortress that was Wankhede.

              " \" US consumer watchdog eyes rules to prevent foreclosures  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Monday it is considering new rules aimed at averting a wave of foreclosures later this year when millions of homeowners are no longer allowed to put off making their mortgage payments.Last year, the federal government suspended foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration as the coronavirus pandemic left millions of people unemployed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did the same for borrowers in single-family homes with loans backed by the two mortgage buyers. The initiatives offered borrowers relief for up to one year and suspended late charges and penalties.As of February, nearly 3 million U.S. homeowners were behind on their home loans, with about 2.1 million mortgages in forbearance and at least 90 days late, according to the CFPB. If current trends continue, there still may be 1.7 million such loans by September, the CFPB said.One rule proposed by the agency would prohibit mortgage servicers from starting the foreclosure process before Dec. 31. The CFPB is also considering whether to permit servicers to initiate foreclosures before the end of this year, in certain cases, such as if they've made efforts to contact an unresponsive borrower.The CFPB is also weighing a rule that would allow servicers to offer “certain streamlined loan modification options” to borrowers with hardships caused by the pandemic, and changes to ensure servicers are notifying borrowers of their options in a timely basis. The agency is seeking public input on its proposed rule changes through May 11. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON \",\n",
              " ' Himachal fighting forest fires after prolonged dry spell  The prolonged dry spell this year has sparked off fires in the chir pine forests of the lower hills of Himachal Pradesh with 845 such incidents reported in April in Shimla, Solan, Mandi, Sirmaur, Bilaspur, Kangra and Hamirpur districts. The raging fire, which causes extensive damage to flora and fauna, has the forest department on its toes. In the past two months, more than 8,455.2 hectares of forest land has been destroyed due to the fire. Himachal Pradesh frequently witnesses forest fires during the dry weather as pines shed resinous needles that are inflammable. February recorded a rain deficit of 82% and March witnessed a deficit of 62%. “Two months have been dry, and the incidents of forest fires have increased as there is less moisture on the ground and temperatures have begun rising,” state forest minister Rakesh Pathania said. “We have roped in the fire department but dousing the blaze in the remote areas, particularly those inaccessible by road, is a challenge. The forest department is trying to rope in local people,” he said. Human negligence sparks off blaze Forest officials say that most fire incidents are started by human negligence as it’s been noticed that they start in and around habitations. More than a dozen such incidents have been reported from areas surrounding Shimla so far this year. The smoke blanket has become a health hazard for residents and environmentalists have sought a solution to the recurring problem. Sanjay Chauhan, a former mayor of Shimla, says, “One such fire is raging in the Junga Forest Range, 25km from Shimla. It’s visible from the Secretariat for the past four days but neither the forest department nor any other department has showed seriousness in dousing it. This forest adjoining Kufri wildlife sanctuary that surrounds Shimla is one of the biggest green covers and the catchment area for water sources of Koti and Brandi. The government should wake up and proactively protect forests.” Replace chir pine with broadleafed trees Environmentalists have suggested framing a forest composition policy and replacing the inflammable chir pine with broadleafed trees in the lower hills. “We see a similar scenario every other year but refuse to face the real issue of replacing the chir pine monocultures that are vulnerable to fire. Until there is policy and the chir is replaced, this problem will persist. It is not the responsibility of the forest department alone. Local communities are custodians living around forests,” says environmentalist Manshi Asher. She suggests creating forest protection committees that can take on this task with the support of the forest department. Fire watchers to aerial surveys to check spread Official data shows that 2018 was the worst year of forest fires with 2,469 incidents reported. It was the highest in eight years in which nearly 25,300 hectares of forest land in the state was burnt. In 2012-13, the second worst year, pine forests over 20,773 hectares were destroyed with a total of 1,798 fires reported. The state forest department has drawn up a policy for converting the chir pine waste into combustible bricks. Besides, it has deployed 6,000 members of the forest staff as fire watchers for the timely dousing of flames. It now plans to conduct aerial surveys to take stock of the situation.

              " ' BJP is not an election-winning machine: PM Modi on party’s foundation day  The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not an election-winning machine, but is on a continuous and relentless campaign to win hearts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday, speaking on the occasion of the party’s 41st foundation day. He also lashed out at regional parties and said the mask of “fake secularism” that they wear is now coming off. Taking a swipe at opponents who dub the BJP an election-winning machine, he said when other parties win elections, the party and the leaders are feted but in the case of the BJP, electoral wins are “perceived with double standards”. “Those who say we are an election-winning machine cannot understand the maturity of the Indian democracy and the intelligence of the voters; they cannot understand the hopes and aspirations of the Indian voters. The BJP is not an election-winning machine, but is on a continuous, relentless campaign to win hearts,” the PM said. Also Watch | ‘BJP means freedom from dynastic politics’: PM Modi on party’s foundation dayAddressing party workers, the PM said the BJP has ensured last-mile delivery of its people-centric policies and has taken into account the aspirations of the marginalised sections that were not at the centre of programmes initiated by previous governments. For the first time the yardstick has changed and the governments are evaluated on the basis of policies (neeti), intent (neeyat) and last-mile delivery, he said. “We serve the people faithfully whether in the government or not; we are connected with the people. We do not take pride that our party won; we take pride that the people of this country made us win,” he said. Taking another dig at regional satraps that have become “dynastic parties”, he said the parties that emerged as representatives of regional aspirations have now become “family-controlled” parties. “In this (BJP) party, workers toil hard and thousands of workers have made sacrifices...In Kerala and in West Bengal our workers are threatened, attacked and their families are also not spared… but they are steadfast in their resolve to live and die for the country, this is the uniqueness of the BJP workers. On the other hand, you have seen what happens to family and dynasty-oriented politics. The parties that talked about regional aspirations have eventually become a family-owned parties and the results are here for all to see. These parties wore a fake mask of secularism which is now being taken off,” he said. While the BJP’s opponents have accused it of not protecting the rights of the minorities and indulging in communal polarisation, the PM said secularism had been transformed to mean policies according to the vote bank and favours only for a few. “Those who makes policies and programmes for everyone and speak about the rights of all are called communal; but Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas has begun to change these definitions,” he said. Reiterating that the country is above all, he said the BJP has never compromised on its values and on issues of national security. “We saw how the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government accepted loss of power by one vote but did not compromise. Our workers suffered during the emergency,” he said. Cautioning workers against “narratives” that seek to create political instability in the country, he cited the examples of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the farm and labour laws. The PM was referring to the protests that erupted when Parliament passed the bill to fast track citizenship for persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries and the bill to bring changes in the farm laws. “I want to take your attention towards a very grave challenge; you would have seen the system of creating narratives has started. [Whether it is] with regard to CAA or the farm laws or the labour laws, every worker should understand that there is politics behind this and a big conspiracy. This means there is an attempt to create political instability in the country, therefore all rumours are being spread, fears are being stoked and lies are being told. Imaginary fears are being created; sometimes it is said that the Constitution will be changed, sometimes that reservation will be withdrawn; sometimes they say citizenship will be withdrawn and sometimes they say farmers’ lands will be taken… all of these are lies but some people and organisations spread them with speed . You need to be alert and with complete information keep going back to the people and create awareness among the people,” the PM said. He said the work of creating fear and wrong narratives is the handiwork of those “who cannot accept their defeat and do this for their own political benefit”. The PM also urged the party members to be humble as the party grows in number and political heft. “We are moving ahead, taking along every region and community, we are everywhere. We are a party of national interest as well as regional aspirations. We do not believe in political untouchability,” he said. He cited how the BJP government paid tributes to Sardar Patel and BR Amedkar and did not refrain from awarding civil awards even to political opponents. SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON ',\n",

              " ' Starting today, night curfew in Delhi from 10pm to 5am amid rising Covid cases  The Delhi government has imposed a night curfew that will be in place every day from 10pm to 5am in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases in the national Capital, senior government officials confirmed to HT.During the seven-hour curfew period, movement of only government officials, healthcare workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed. “The situation of Covid-19 in NCT of Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a sudden increase in Covid-19 cases in recent past along with high positivity rate and therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi from 10pm to 5am, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure for well being and safety of people,” read the order issued by acting chief secretary Satya Gopal on behalf of the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA). It will be in force till April 30 or until further orders. The order, however, states that those working in private companies and engaged in essential services will have to get an e-pass for travelling within the city. The e-pass can be a hard or a soft copy which can be obtained by applying on the website www.delhi.gov.in, it stated. Besides, e-passes will also be required for those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination. “The concerned district magistrates shall be responsible for issuance of e-passes for above activities and for overall implementation of these measures in their respective jurisdiction concerned,” read the order. Also Read | Amid rise in Covid-19 cases, Delhi govt orders increase in hospital bedsPublic transport such as Delhi Metro/ public buses/ autos/ taxis shall be allowed to function within the stipulated time for the transportation of only above-mentioned categories of people. The order also clarified that there will be no restriction on interstate and intra-state movement, transportation of essential or non-essential goods. It stated that no separate permission / e-pass will be required for such movements. But, those arriving in the city from airports, railway stations, lSBTs will be allowed to travel on production of a valid ticket. The curfew will mean that all restaurants, markets, wedding venues, pubs and other places where people gather will have to close up by 10pm every day.The decision was taken as the Capital registered 3,548 new cases on Monday – a number that was slightly lower than Sunday, although this was due to fewer tests. Consequently, the test positivity rate inched above 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization identifies as ideal for an outbreak to be considered as under control. Night curfews are one of the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) used in other states as well. These include districts in Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The strictest of the measures are in Maharashtra, where authorities imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses to shut down, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.

              " ' Bihar pollution board seeks check on air pollution amid Covid-19 surge  With the air quality index (AQI) in Patna and other cities remaining in the range between poor to hazardous, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has reiterated the need for government agencies’ help to curb toxic emissions and release of particles suspended in the air. In view of the rise in coronavirus cases, said to worsen and spread rapidly when the air quality is poor, BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said the board will again sent letters to all the concerned departments, such as road construction, building construction, road and urban development seeking strict adherence to the clean air action plan and steps to check contamination of air. Nearly 800-1000 Covid-19 positive cases are being reported in Bihar after the resurgence of the disease in the past few days. Citing the recent study on factors for ambient air pollution, Ghosh said that neighbourhood or outside boundary sources were the major contributors for deterioration in AQI in Patna. “Domestic pollution, which is mainly caused due to biomass burning, is another major issue that the government should step in to address,” added the chairman. He said department of transport and industries were no longer contributing to the worsening AQI. “The Board has embarked up on a major drive to install state of the art air quality monitoring stations across the state to know the source of pollutants and take corrective steps to check them at the source,” said Ghosh. Chief executive officer of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) Ramapati Kumar said that the prevailing scenario necessitated framing of city-based micro level planning to ensure smooth implementation of the clean air action plan. “The district level officers should be sensitised about strategy and implementation process of the plan. Apart from this, the government shall act on achieving low-hanging fruits such as replacing solid fuel with cleaner sources,” said Kumar. After strengthening the network to monitor AQI in Patna, the BSPCB has initiated steps to install air quality monitoring stations in 24 districts, besides Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, this year. The board earlier proposed to set up air quality monitoring stations in all 38 districts, but availability of fund from both the Centre and the state government, restricted the plan to 24 districts of Valmikinagar, Siwan, Chapra, Buxar, Ara, Sasaram, Motihari, Bettiah, Muzaffapur, Aurangabad, Gaya, Rajgir, Begusarai, Bihar Sharif, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Muger, Saharsa, Bhagalpur, Katihar, Purnia, Araria and Kishanganj.

              " ' Maoists issue statement, say their fight not against security forces  The banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) has issued a statement claiming its fight is not against police or security forces while questioning Union home minister Amit Shah comments in the aftermath of the killing of 22 security personnel in an ambush in Chhattisgarh over the weekend.Shah, who visited Chhattisgarh on Monday, said the sacrifice of the 22 will be remembered for taking the battle against the extremists to a “decisive turn” and that the counter-insurgency battle will be intensified to take it to a “logical end”. The Maoists ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to an area near the Bijapur-Sukma border while they were out on a combing operation in a forest area.Also Read | Fight against Maoists will continue at quicker pace: Chhattisgarh CM“From whom Amit Shah will avenge? Oppressed people and Maoists are the same and day by day, the oppressed people are raising their voice against the capitalist and Brahminical government...” Maoist spokesman Abhay said in the statement on Monday.“We believe that those getting recruited into the forces are also part of the exploited people and it is our compulsion to fight when they come with weapons to fight us. We have sympathies with the families of the deceased and CPI (Maoist) appeal to the people not to send their children to join the security forces.”The statement claimed that 28 Maoists have been killed in the last four months across the country and they have been able “to kill or injure nearly 100 policemen” during the same time.It cautioned Maoists over the newer technology being used by the state and urged them to be cautious while engaging with it.

              " ' Dotlines CTO Eftekhar builds the first-ever DIY productivity & security solution  India, 2nd April 2021: Back at the start of his career 10 years ago, working in the fast-growing internet services companies, Mr. Eftekhar knew deep in his mind that dependence on the internet will only rise exponentially and the millions of connected homes and businesses will be needing a practical and robust tool to get the best of internet, minus the threats and dangers it brings along.With a deep understanding of IP networking, coupled with his sparkling talent in application networking, Eftekhar U Chy started building the 1st-ever do-it-yourself or DIY internet control and security solution — Audra (www.audra.io). The rising tech-titan and his AI/ML-powered cloud solution bring new hope for SMEs in their fearless growth. With an on-prem appliance, tagged with machine learning backed robust AI-cloud application, which is also conveniently controlled by a mobile app, Audra is definitely the answer to many homes and small businesses across Asia and beyond. When it comes to internet security, Audra aims to be the right fit for them.Eftekhar now spearheads the Singapore-based technology entity Dotlines as its CTO. The group continues to bag spectacular growth across continents, with the innovations Eftekhar and his vigorous technology organization bring for the group. The group does business in more than 12 verticals, all powered by his state-of-the-art technology platforms.“Audra is a key vertical in our group, and it offers a complete suite of solutions across the internet pyramid. It gives efficient protection for ISPs, iron-clad security for enterprises, productivity and safeguarding for small-medium businesses, parental control and threat-prevention for homes, and finally easily-done protection for personal devices”, said Eftekhar.He informed that 80% of hackers choose Asian SMEs as an easy target because they are well-unprotected. Not only that, 60% of employees spend one-third of their time doing personal stuff, and thus SMEs lose a lot on the productivity side.He added, “Asia is thriving on the substantial SME base, and we see they are increasingly getting digitalized. Countries like Indonesia, India are no different. But most of them think they are not vulnerable, find market solutions complex and 90% of them have no IT personnel to manage office network. We at Dotlines, always do purpose-driven innovation, and Audra is an outcome of that philosophy. We built Audra in a way, so that, it is extremely simple to set up (no IT background needed), convenient to set rules for productivity and security of office network (pre-set rules, control from an easy user app in the phone) and affordable for SME owners to own this with no hassle.”“India, with its massive base of 60+ million MSMEs, need a solid answer to the concerns they have, when it comes to business digitalization. We strongly believe – Audra is the best of the answers. Therefore, with our proven tracks in Indonesia, Malaysia, we are confident, SMEs in India will also adopt the simple, convenient and affordable products and security benefits Audra offers,” concluded Eftekhar.Audra’s marvel is set around its superbly practical end-user-based design-thinking and highly efficient solution architecture. Its sophisticated machine learning algorithm powers up its Cloud AI, which delivers unprecedented practicality and robustness, when it comes to internet control to bring employee productivity in and push known/unknown cyber threats out.To know more, visit Audra.

              " ' White House press briefing gets surprise visit from Easter Bunny  White House celebrated Easter spirit on Monday (local time) with a staffer dressed as the Easter Bunny making an appearance at the media room while press secretary Jen Psaki was concluding her briefing.The life-sized bunny, appropriately wearing a mask to reflect the precautions taken by humans during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, handed out commemorative eggs and chocolates to reporters in the room.\"We have a special guest. I will say that we know that this is one of the events where people get to take their children, family members, friends to,\" White House press secretary Psaki said as the Easter Bunny walked towards the podium. \"It\\'s not quite the same. We\\'ll do a big one next year, but we still wanted to have a visitor and some special commemorative Easter eggs for all of you from the president and First Lady,\" she added. The Easter Bunny poses in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 5, 2021. (REUTERS) Earlier in the afternoon, the Easter bunny had appeared at an event where President Joe Biden delivered remarks marking the Easter holiday instead of the traditional White House Easter Egg Roll, which was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the coronavirus pandemic.From a balcony the president delivered brief remarks denoting the holiday, which he celebrated at Camp David a day earlier. Biden said he looked forward to the return of the egg roll next year.The White House eggs handed out to reporters were multicoloured and decorated with a picture of a rabbit wearing a mask on the front and signatures of Biden and first lady Jill Biden on the back, the Hill reported.Meghan Hays, White House director of message planning, later tweeted a photo of herself revealing that she was playing the part of the Easter Bunny at the media room briefing.\"Is this what they mean when they say \"other duties as assigned\"?! So great to stop by @PressSec\\'s briefing today. Happy Easter!\" she tweeted.At the event with the president and first lady Lt. Col. Brandon Westling played the role of the Easter Bunny. Below the balcony of the First Couple were cutouts of bunnies with masks and egg-shaped cutouts.The Hill explained that the White House typically hosts hundreds of people for the Easter egg roll, where children gather on the South Lawn to partake in the annual tradition as the president and first lady look on. But the event was scrapped last year in the early weeks of the pandemic and was called off again this year as the country works to get case numbers under control.The president and first lady also sent wooden commemorative eggs to Covid-19 vaccination sites around the country to mark the holiday.

            "TaggedDocument( Karan Patel angry with partial lockdown: 'Stupid and outright senseless'  Actor Karan Patel has questioned the partial lockdown and restrictions imposed in Maharashtra, especially in wake of the political rallies that continue as usual, without following any of the Covid-19 safety rules.Karan took to Instagram Stories and wrote, “Actors CAN continue to shoot for their projects. Cricketers CAN continue to play their matches, day or night. Politicians CAN hold rallies with thousands of people States CAN conduct elections and expect you to come out to vote. BUT the common man cannot go to work. #Stupid and Outright senseless.” A screenshot of Karan's post. Maharashtra is under partial lockdown, with night curfew and weekend lockdown imposed earlier this week and will remain in place till April 30. However, retailers, traders and a few other sectors have been protesting against the partial lockdown and the government is likely to tweak its standard operating procedures (SOPs), offering relaxations to a few sectors soon. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with them and hinted at the relaxations.Actor Nakuul Mehta also seemed to have similar views as Karan. He posted on his Instagram Stories, \"Political rallies - Not needed, Bollywood Awards Shows - Nah, Religious Gathering - No, Kumbh Mela - Deffo not BUT ALONE IN CAR - YAAAS!!!!!\" He was reacting to the new rule of wearing a mask inside the car in Delhi even when driving alone. A glimpse of Nakuul's post. “The restrictions imposed are out of compulsion amid the second wave. Not only traders and business, even the state is facing losses to the exchequer. We will definitely reconsider the decision and offer some relaxation after a due deliberation with task force, police administration and other departments,” the CM said.Also read: Kangana claims Akshay, others messaged her secretly praising Thalaivi trailer SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON Topics karan patel nakuul mehta lockdown 2.0 maharashtra + 2 more Related Stories The trailer of Kangana Ranaut's Thalaivi was unveiled on her birthday in March. bollywood Kangana claims Akshay, others messaged her secretly praising Thalaivi trailer By HT Entertainment Desk PUBLISHED ON APR 07, 2021 10:39 PM IST Kangana Ranaut, in a new tweet, has claimed that while a number of big stars have congratulated her for Thalaivi trailer secretly, none will do in public because of 'movie mafia terror'.

            " Tanha bail plea: HC seeks unredacted statements of protected witnesses  New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed a trial court to give in a sealed cover the unredacted statements of protected witnesses for deciding the bail plea of Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha.Tanha was arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in May last year for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” in the north-east Delhi riots that happened in February last year.“The trial court is directed to forward the original unredacted statements of protected witnesses in a sealed cover to this court on or before the next date of hearing, that is, April 14,” said a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani.With this direction, it allowed and disposed of an application by the Delhi Police seeking to call for unredacted statements of protected witnesses in a sealed cover from the trial court. Names and personal details of protected witnesses are redacted in their statements.The high court, which had on March 18 reserved its order on Tanha’s bail plea, had asked the police to file written submissions, unredacted copies of witness statements and other relevant documents.During the proceedings, the court also frowned on the prosecution for the absence of unredacted statements of the witnesses with them.Special public prosecutor (SPP) Rajat Nair, representing the police, said these are protected witnesses and the unredacted copies are with the trial court only. He pointed out that when the investigating officer had applied for protection of witnesses, the statements were signed and sealed by the trial court judge and redacted copies were given to the investigation officer.Tanha has challenged a trial court’s October 26, 2020, order which dismissed his bail application.

READ FULL STORY '], [400, ' Joji movie review: Top-rate crime thriller headlined by a terrific Fahadh Faasil ', ' Joji movie review: Top-rate crime thriller headlined by a terrific Fahadh Faasil  JojiDirector: Dileesh PothanCast: Fahadh Faasil, Baburaj, Shammi Thilakan and Sunny PNJoji, which is the third direct-OTT release for Fahadh Faasil in a span of six months, marks the third time collaboration for the star with director Dileesh Pothan and writer Syam Pushkaran. With each outing, the combo has only got stronger and managed to deliver work that will stand the test of time.In Joji, a top-rate crime thriller that examines the fall of a family, Dileep and Pushkaran join hands to explore the concept of greed and how it pushes someone to the edge until he loses it. Based on William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the film follows the events in the Kuttappan family after an unfortunate incident. Fahadh plays Joji, the youngest son of the Kuttappan family and he has big aspirations. However, his father feels he’s nothing but a loser. The two other sons are also controlled by their father and it’s a family powered by domineering patriarchy. But when the father suffers a stroke and is half-paralyzed, each member of the family has his/her own reason to celebrate. At the same time, the sons also feel that they will lose everything if their father recovers and survives. Joji comes up with a plan and pulls off the perfect crime but what follows snowballs into something messier.The film, aided by Syam Pushkaran’s solid writing, beautifully explores the dynamics of a family torn apart by greed and power. Even though based on Macbeth, the story feels highly relatable, and the characters are hard to judge. Joji works effectively as a slow-burning psychological drama as much as it’s about a crime and the events that follow. It’s more of a psychological drama because you’re left to wonder what’s cooking in Joji’s mind after he commits the first crime.The slow buildup to the crime is strongly complemented by the haunting score of Justin Varghese and the breathtaking visuals of Shyju Khalid. After committing the first crime, Joji wakes up the next morning and goes for a run and he reaches the top of a nearby mountain. When he stands at the tip of the mountain and looks down upon his house nearby, the visual is both beautiful and chilling.Also read: Anushka Sharma attempts to lift Virat Kohli in new video, watch her happy reaction on pulling it offIn what’s easily one of his juiciest performances in recent times, Fahadh breathes life into Joji – a sly, sadistic character with absolutely no remorse. It’s amazing how each of his collaborations with Dileesh and Syam has only resulted in a performance that’s hard to forget. As Joji, Fahadh is unbelievably good, bringing in a very sinister presence with his performance.The supporting cast is equally good, especially Unnimaya Prasad as Bincy, the daughter-in-law of the house. Her character is a modern-day version of lady Macbeth, and she’s equally terrifying with a calm presence.

From the fast paced Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq, Hia badminton style sporty dancing in Dhal Gaya Din, the hook and aerobic like dance steps in Naino Mein Sapna and the PT style dancing in Taki Taki, have rightfully earned him the title of Jumping Jack of Bollywood. On his 79th birthday, we talk to a few young choreographers of the country today and know how the veteran actor has inspired them. Dancer-choreographer Melvin Louis Melvin LouisI am a big Jeetu sir fan. Back then not just to be a dancer but to have a distinctive style come out is amazing. The kind of stuff that he did with the energy and expression and the distinctive style, his steps, his turn and walk. It is very iconic even today because that was his own peculiar style which he would add to the choreography. His name is right at the top when it comes to actors with great dancing. For me my favorite song is Dhal Gaya Din (Humjoli, 1970). Actor-dancer Raghav Juyal Raghav JuyalAs an actor and dance he has been always inspiring for me. From my childhood I have always looked upon on him and he is such a flawless performer that his songs makes you groove every time you see. He has given some remarkable dancing moves which I always love to do. My favourite song of Jeetu ji is Taki O Taki (Himmatwala, 1983). Choreographer Punit J Pathak Punit J PathakHe is one of the legends as far as dancing is concerned. He is rightfully called the Jumping Jack because he was always high on energy as far as the songs were concerned. I feel any artiste is more appreciated when the person is genuine and nice so I met him a few time on a dance reality show, he was so nice. There has been no one else like him again. I personally love his song is Naino Mein Sapna (Himmatwala, 1983). Choreographer Kruti Mahesh Kruti MaheshHis style of dancing was unique. Today we see heroes and yes they are good but they try to learn different dance styles and they try and become dancers also but the era for Jeetu ji was such that he had his own style. He had such flamboyance to his dancing and there was no inhibition per say and I got one opportunity to teach him for some video that Ekta Kapoor was doing from home so we had the opportunity to do a couple of steps with him. One of my favourites is Taki O Taki (Himmatwala, 1983).

With a host of biggies such as Bachchan Pandey, Bhediya and Ganpath in her kitty, she is of course excited. And on top of that, it was also recently announced that she will be joining Prabhas and Saif Ali Khan in AdipurushEven though Covid cases continue to rise, the film industry has got back on it’s feet, and been making announcements for new films. Shoots are going on in full swing. A lot of films made their way onto OTT platforms. Sanon says she would prefer theatrical releases for all her films. “Obviously, as an actor you want the film to reach more number of audiences, and beyond just the audience of OTT. Of course, they are great platforms, and everyone is hooked on to it, they have got great content. As an actor you want it to reach the masses, even the ones who don’t really go on these platforms,” says the 30-year-old, whose film Mimi, in which she plays a surrogate mother, is also waiting for a release.It’s been some time the film was announced and has been shot. Ask what’s happening on that front, and Sanon says she recently wrapped up work on the last son. “Mimi as a film needs to reach the masses. It is based on surrogacy, it’s a unique subject and made in a very entertaining manner. It is something that will touch your heart, make you cry, laugh, and leave you with food for thought. It should be watched by more people who are rooted in areas where OTT isn’t watched,” she says.In fact, it was raining release dates until now in Bollywood, which is why the actor is more than keen that her film also gets one soon. “We are very excited for Mimi to release. The times we are in, it’s important for a film like that to get a release. I am hoping things normalize soon. There are so many films pending to release in general. I am hoping Mimi does too, soon, sometime around mid 2021. I don’t know what the producers are deciding. They are also figuring out a good date. It should get what it deserves,” says Sanon.Interact with the author on Twitter/ @RishabhSuri02Follow @htshowbiz on Twitter SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON '], [868, ' Why do we pick problematic partners? ', ' Why do we pick problematic partners?  Humans crave love ever since birth, love from parents, siblings, friends, and eventually from their partners. Everybody has a certain type of people they feel attracted to and want to be in love with. The types may vary from jolly, kind, introvert, adventurous, and so on. ‘Problematic’ is probably the last trait people are looking for in their partners. Then why do some people choose to suffer from problematic partners but still can’t let go? There is a famous quote by Stephen Chbosky in his novel, the perks of being a wallflower, “We accept the love, we think we deserve.” Do some people think they deserve problematic partners, or they overlook the problems and continue to suffer? Experts tell us why. Psychological History Experts believe, the kind of partner we look for in our adult life is a reflection of the love we received as a kid, the relationship that we witnessed between our parents. The first exposure of those feelings leaves a permanent mark on our vision of love and we try to look for people who can evoke the same feelings, we are comfortable and familiar with. Sometimes these feelings are not pleasant, for instance, if someone grew up around an abusive parent or was abused as a child. They will be okay with an abusive partner, unlike others. If someone grew up with a depressed or aloof parent, they would find themselves attracted to the people who will replicate the same set of emotions. Self-perception People with a negative perception of selves tend to walk into a problematic relationship. They choose partners in the consonance of their negative view of self. The feeling of not deserving something good and substantial keeps them from looking for a positive partner. It’s hard for some people to take a compliment because their mind is flushed with all the negatives views of self, which is why they feel uncomfortable around people who appreciate them and tries to make them feel good about themselves. Whereas the partner who supports their unenthusiastic self-perception brings them a sense of comfort. Empaths“They will be devastated if I leave them,” is often the idea, empaths resort to while choosing to stay in a problematic relationship. People with extreme empathy cannot bring harm to anyone consciously, they may choose to suffer, which is exactly what happens in toxic relationships if either person is an empath. They start neglecting themselves in order to protect and care for others. Thinking one is not good enough, they take a people-pleasing route and go miles to rescue and please people. A toxic partner would keep an empath close and cater to each other’s need of being rescued and rescuing respectively. Catering to each other’s need, a negative person and an empath makes for a perfect match. Fear A drowning person in the sea would grab anything to save themselves, likewise, a person drowning in the fear of being left alone or the fear of not being good enough makes them choose a problematic partner. But why can’t they get out of the relationship even after suffering? Experts say that staying in a dysfunctional relationship over a period of time takes a toll on one’s self-confidence, self-image, and ability to be fully themselves. The increase in anxiety and stress is astronomical under such situations. Even if people try to come out of a toxic relationship, the undesirable thought of not finding someone makes people suffer and continue with the relationship. How can you come out of this cycle? Your relationship with others is a reflection of your relationship with yourselves. Growing up in an uninformed environment makes it difficult to understand the patterns of toxicity. The first step towards improving your judgment is to become self-aware. Being aware of your needs and wants in relationships and otherwise. In order to cultivate a healthy relationship with others, it’s imperative to nurture a healthy relationship with ourselves. One has to stop living in denial, denial of their pain and suffering, addressing the problem is the first step towards a solution.(Inputs from Pulkit Sharma, Clinical Psychologist, and Shaira Chaudhry, Wellness Facilitator) SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON '], [227, ' Shraddha Kapoor treats fans to sunkissed pictures from Maldives ', ' Shraddha Kapoor treats fans to sunkissed pictures from Maldives  Bollywood star Shraddha Kapoor on Wednesday treated her fans to a mesmerising sun-kissed picture as she posed in the Maldives.
